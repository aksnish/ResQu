TI  - The formation of short-chain fatty acids is positively associated with the blood lipid-lowering effect of lupin kernel fiber in moderately hypercholesterolemic adults.
AB  - Lupin kernel fiber beneficially modifies blood lipids because of its bile acid-binding capacity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive effects of a lupin kernel fiber preparation on cardiovascular diseases and to clarify possible mechanisms. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover trial, 60 moderately hypercholesterolemic adults (plasma total cholesterol: >5.2 mmol/L) passed 3 intervention periods in different orders with a 2-wk washout phase between each. Participants consumed either a high-fiber diet containing 25-g/d lupin kernel fiber (LF) or citrus fiber (CF), or a low-fiber control diet (CD) for 4 wk each. Anthropometric, plasma, and fecal variables were assessed at baseline and after the interventions. Contrary to the CF period, total (9%) and LDL (12%) cholesterol as well as triacylglycerols (10%) were lower after the LF period when compared with the CD period [P  0.02, adjusted for baseline, age, gender, and body mass index (BMI)]. HDL cholesterol remained unchanged. Moreover, the LF period reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P = 0.02) and systolic blood pressure (P = 0.01) when compared with baseline. Bile acid binding could not be shown because the excretion of total bile acids remained constant after the high-fiber diets. However, the LF period resulted in an enhanced formation of the main short-chain fatty acids in comparison with the CD period. During the CF period, only acetate increased significantly. Both high-fiber diets led to higher satiety and modified nutritional behavior, resulting in significantly lower body weight, BMI, and waist circumference compared with the CD period. The blood lipid-lowering effects of LF are apparently not a result of bile acid binding. Rather, we hypothesize for the first time, to our knowledge, that the blood lipid-lowering effects of LF may be mainly attributed to the formation of short-chain fatty acids, specifically propionate and acetate. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01035086.

TI  - The relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients treated with pravastatin: main results of the APPROACH-J study.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia without a history of CVD. Patients who were receiving or started treatment with pravastatin, were followed-up for 2 years. Patients were divided into quartiles according to on-treatment LDL-C. The maximum contrast method based on the Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the relationship between achieved LDL-C and the incidence of CVD. Incidence of CVD was also compared according to whether a number of risk factor targets were achieved. A total 6,229 patients were enrolled, with 4,916 having reported LDL-C values. During the 2 years, 69 cases of CVD (6.7/1000 patient years), including 36 coronary artery disease (CAD) (3.5/1000 patient years) and 28 strokes (2.7/1000 patient years), occurred. The comparison of on-treatment LDL-C level quartiles suggested that the incidence of all CVD decreased linearly as the LDL-C levels decreased. Incidence of CAD showed a curvilinear relationship to LDL-C levels, suggesting some attenuation of risk below LDL-C of 119 mg/dL. The incidence of all CVD and CAD tended to be decreased as the number of achieved risk factor targets increased. In conclusion, through our observational study, it was shown that a linear relationship between the incidence of CVD and LDL-C was observed in high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients. The low incidence of CVD in the present study may be associated with multifactorial management of conventional risk factors including high LDL-C levels. However, prospective, randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - A softgel dietary supplement containing esterified plant sterols and stanols improves the blood lipid profile of adults with primary hypercholesterolemia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled replication study.
AB  - A well-controlled clinical trial previously demonstrated the efficacy of a novel softgel dietary supplement providing 1.8 g/day esterified plant sterols and stanols, as part of the National Cholesterol Education Program Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet, to improve the fasting lipid profile of men and women with primary hypercholesterolemia (fasting low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol  130 and <220 mg/dL [ 3.37 and <5.70 mmol/L]). The purpose of this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover study (conducted July 2011 to January 2012) was to support these previous findings in a similar, but independent, sample with a different lead investigator and research site. Repeated measures analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes for sterol/stanol and placebo treatment conditions using the baseline value as a covariate. Forty-nine subjects were screened and 30 (8 men and 22 women) were randomized to treatment (all completed the trial). Baseline (mean  standard error of the mean) plasma lipid concentrations were: total cholesterol 236.6  4.2 mg/dL (6.11  0.11 mmol/L), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 56.8  3.0 mg/dL (1.47  0.08 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol 151.6  3.3 mg/dL (3.92  0.09 mmol/L), non-HDL cholesterol 179.7  4.6 mg/dL (4.64  0.12 mmol/L), and triglycerides 144.5  14.3 mg/dL (1.63  0.16 mmol/L). Mean placebo-adjusted reductions in plasma lipid levels were significant (P<0.01) for LDL cholesterol (-4.3%), non-HDL cholesterol (-4.1%), and total cholesterol (-3.5%), but not for triglycerides or HDL cholesterol. These results support the efficacy of 1.8 g/day esterified plant sterols/stanols in softgel capsules, administered as an adjunct to the National Cholesterol Education Program Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet, to augment reductions in atherogenic lipid levels in individuals with hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Lipid lowering in healthy volunteers treated with multiple doses of MGL-3196, a liver-targeted thyroid hormone receptor- agonist.
AB  - MGL-3196 is an oral, liver-targeted selective agonist for the thyroid hormone receptor- (THR-) that is being developed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. The safety profile and tolerability of THR- agonist MGL-3196 was assessed in first-in humans studies, including a single ascending dose study (NCT01367873) in which MGL-3196 appeared safe at all doses tested. A two-week multiple dose study was conducted at doses of 5, 20, 50, 80, 100, and 200mg per day in healthy subjects with mildly elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (>110mg/dL) (NCT01519531). MGL-3196 was well-tolerated at all doses with no dose-related adverse events or liver enzyme, ECG or vital-sign changes. At the highest dose, there was a reversible reduction of 20% in the level of pro-hormone, free thyroxine (free T4) that was significantly different from placebo (p<0.0001) that may be explained by increased hepatic metabolism of T4. There was no change in thyrotropin (TSH) or triiodothyronine (free T3) or other evidence of central thyroid axis dysfunction at any dose. Doses ranging from 50 to 200mg demonstrated highly statistically significant reductions relative to placebo of up to: 30% for LDL cholesterol (range, p=0.05-<0.0001); 28% for non- high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (range, p=0.027-0.0001); 24% for Apolipoprotein B (range, p=0.008-0.0004), and statistical trends of up to 60% reduction in triglycerides (TG) (range, p=0.13-0.016). The near maximal lipid effects were observed at a dose of 80mg daily. In summary, in a two-week study in healthy volunteers with mild LDL cholesterol elevation, MGL-3196 appeared safe, was well-tolerated and showed a beneficial effect on lipid parameters.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe added to atorvastatin versus atorvastatin uptitration or switching to rosuvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - Hypercholesterolemic patients (n= 1,547) at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels 100 and 160mg/dl while treated with atorvastatin 10mg/day entered a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, clinical trial using two 6-week study periods. Period I compared the efficacy/safety of (1) adding ezetimibe 10mg (ezetimibe) to stable atorvastatin 10mg, (2) doubling atorvastatin to 20mg, or (3) switching to rosuvastatin 10mg. Subjects in the latter 2 groups who persisted with elevated LDL-C levels (100 and 160mg/dl) after period I, entered period II; subjects on atorvastatin 20mg had ezetimibe added to their atorvastatin 20mg, or uptitrated their atorvastatin to 40mg; subjects on rosuvastatin 10mg switched to atorvastatin 20mg plus ezetimibe or uptitrated their rosuvastatin to 20mg. Some subjects on atorvastatin 10mg plus ezetimibe continued the same treatment into period II. At the end of period I, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 10mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 20mg or rosuvastatin 10mg (22.2% vs 9.5% or 13.0%, respectively, p <0.001). At the end of period II, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 40mg (17.4% vs 6.9%, p <0.001); switching from rosuvastatin 10mg to ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than uptitrating to rosuvastatin 20mg (17.1% vs 7.5%, p<0.001). Relative to comparative treatments, ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10mg (periodI) or atorvastatin 20mg (period II) produced significantly greater percent attainment of LDL-C targets <100 or <70mg/dl, and significantly greater percent reductions in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, most lipid and lipoprotein ratios, and apolipoprotein B (except ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20 vs atorvastatin 40mg). Reports of adverse experiences were generally similar among groups. In conclusion, treatment of hypercholesterolemic subjects at high cardiovascular risk with ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 or 20mg produced significantly greater improvements in key lipid parameters and significantly greater attainment of LDL-C treatment targets than doubling atorvastatin or switching to (or doubling) rosuvastatin at thecompared doses.

TI  - Red yeast rice improves lipid pattern, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and vascular remodeling parameters in moderately hypercholesterolemic Italian subjects.
AB  - Despite a recent health claim by the European Agency on Food Safety, the effect of high doses of dietary monacolin supplements from red yeast rice on cholesterolemia has not been tested in Italian subjects. Our aim via a crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was to test if a short-term treatment with 10 mg monacolins could improve lipid pattern, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and vascular remodeling biomarkers in a small cohort of Mediterranean subjects. Thus, 25 healthy, mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects were enrolled, and after 4 weeks of a stabilization diet, subjects were randomized to the sequence placebo-washout-monacolins or monacolins-washout-placebo, with each period being 4 weeks long. At each study step, a complete lipid pattern, safety parameters, hs-CRP, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 levels were measured. When compared to the placebo group, monacolins-treated patients experienced a more favorable percent change in total cholesterol (-12.45%, 95% CI -16.19 to -8.71), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-21.99%, 95% CI -26.63 to -17.36), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-14.67%, 95% CI -19.22 to -10.11), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (-28.05%, 95% CI -35.18 to -20.93), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (-27.19%, 95% CI -36.21 to -18.15), and hs-CRP (-23.77%, 95% CI -30.54 to -17.01). No significant differences were observed in regards to triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and safety parameters. On the basis of our data, we demonstrate that a 10-mg monacolin nutraceutical appears to safely reduce cholesterolemia, hs-CRP, and markers of vascular remodeling in Italian subjects. These results have to be confirmed in larger patient samples and longer studies.

TI  - Long-term follow-up of moderately hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients following randomization to pravastatin vs usual care: the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT-LLT).
AB  - The authors conducted a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial, in which they assigned well-controlled hypertensive participants aged 55years and older with moderate hypercholesterolemia to receive pravastatin (n=5170) or usual care (n=5185) for 4 to 8years, when trial therapy was discontinued. Passive surveillance using national databases to ascertain deaths and hospitalizations continued for a total follow-up of 8 to 13years to assess whether mortality and morbidity differences persisted or new differences developed. During the post-trial period, fatal and nonfatal outcomes were available for 98% and 64% of participants, respectively. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and the secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and end-stage renal disease. No significant differences appeared in mortality for pravastatin vs usual care (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.03) or other secondary outcomes. Similar to the previously reported in-trial result, there was a significant treatment effect for CHD in black patients (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98). However, the in-trial result showing a significant treatment by race effect did not remain significant during the entire follow-up (P=.08). These findings are consistent with evidence from other large trials that show statins prevent CHD and add evidence that they are effective for CHD prevention in black patients.

TI  - Combination pravastatin and valsartan treatment has additive beneficial effects to simultaneously improve both metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes beyond that of monotherapy with either drug in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - Statin and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker therapy improves endothelial dysfunction using distinct mechanisms. We evaluated simultaneous vascular and metabolic responses to pravastatin and valsartan therapy, alone or in combination, in hypercholesterolemic patients. Forty-eight hypercholesterolemic patients (23 had metabolic syndrome) were given pravastatin 40 mg and placebo, pravastatin 40 mg and valsartan 160 mg, or valsartan 160 mg and placebo daily during each 2-month treatment period in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with three treatment arms and two washout periods (each 2 months). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and C-reactive protein improved to a greater extent with combined therapy compared with either monotherapy. Importantly, we also observed simultaneous improvement in metabolic phenotypes, with all three treatments causing increased plasma adiponectin levels, reduced fasting insulin levels, and increased insulin sensitivity relative to baseline measurements. For the first time in a statin combination trial, pravastatin combined with valsartan therapy increased plasma adiponectin, lowered fasting insulin levels, and improved insulin sensitivity in an additive manner when compared with monotherapy alone. In contrast to other statins, hydrophilic pavastatin may be combined with other drugs to safely reach lipid target levels while simultaneously improving the metabolic and cardiovascular phenotype of patients at high risk.

TI  - Achieving recommended low density lipoprotein cholesterol goals and the factors associated with target achievement of hypercholesterolemia patients with rosuvastatin in primary care.
AB  - Our observations of the short period for hypercholesterolemia in Korean primary care has revealed that the rate of achieving target LDL-C levels was high in these patients, whereas patients at higher risk for cardiovascular disease tended to have lower LDL-C achievement outcomes. Primary care physicians should pay more attention to patients showing higher cardiovascular risk and stress the need for good adherence and management regimens in these individuals.

TI  - Relationship between low-density lipoprotein levels on admission and 1-year outcome in patients with acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.
AB  - This study assessed the relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels on admission and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (ASTEMI). Patients with ASTEMI who had a lipid profile tested within 24 hours of symptom onset were enrolled. They were stratified into high and low LDL-C groups according to whether their LDL-C was above (n=501) or below (n=575) the median level, respectively. The incidence of MACE, cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, revascularization, and stroke was compared between the groups at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard analysis were performed. In-hospital use of beta blockers was better in the high than in the low LDL-C group (76.6% vs. 69.7%, p=0.01). Statin use was significantly higher in the high than in the low LDL-C group during follow-up (86.8% vs. 80.0%, p=0.003 at1 month; 71.6% vs. 62.4%, p=0.002 at 6 months; 67.8% vs. 61.2%, p=0.03 at 1 year). The incidence of MACE on follow-up at 1 month was higher in the low than in the high LDL-C group (12.0% vs. 8.1%, p=0.04). At 1 year, survival was not significantly different between the groups. Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated that the incidence of MACE was significantly associated with hypertension, current smoking, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), in-hospital use of beta blockers, and statin use on follow-up (p<0.01). LDL-C levels on admission in patients with ASTEMI had no significant effect on the 6-month and 1-year incidence of MACE, but the incidence of MACE was significantly higher in the low LDL-C group at 1 month. It would be relevant to further investigate the HDL-C level on admission, in-hospital use of beta blockers, and statin use during follow-up in relation to MACE.

TI  - Impact of adding ezetimibe to statin to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal (from the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation [COURAGE] trial).
AB  - In the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) study, a revascularization strategy trial with optimal medical therapy in both arms, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal was 60 to 85 mg/dl; this was revised to <70 mg/dl in 2004. COURAGE patients (n= 2,287) were titrated with increasing statin doses to achieve the initial LDL cholesterol goal using a prespecified protocol. Ezetimibe was not available when study enrollment began in 1999 but became available after approval in 2003. After maximizing statin dose, ezetimibe was added to reach the LDL cholesterol goal in 34% of patients (n= 734). Median baseline LDL cholesterol was higher in patients who received ezetimibe than in those who did not (109 vs 96 mg/dl). At baseline, 18% of patients who would later receive ezetimibe had LDL cholesterol <85 mg/dl, and 8% had LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl. On maximum tolerated statin (with or without other lipid-lowering drugs), 40% had LDL cholesterol <85 mg/dl and 23% had LDL cholesterol <70mg/dl before starting ezetimibe. At the final study visit, 68% of ezetimibe patients achieved LDL cholesterol <85 mg/dl, and 46% achieved LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl. Using Cox regression analysis, the most significant factors associated with achieving LDL cholesterol goals were lower baseline LDL cholesterol, average statin dose, and ezetimibe use. In conclusion, after maximizing statin dose, the addition of ezetimibe results in a substantial increase in the percentage of patients who reach LDL cholesterol goal, a key component of optimal medical therapy.

TI  - Intensive lipid-lowering therapy for slowing progression as well as inducing regression of atherosclerosis in Japanese patients: subanalysis of the JART study.
AB  - This paper describes a subanalysis of the JART Study comparing rosuvastatin and pravastatin treatment. A total of 314 subjects were analyzed in this subanalysis, 282 of whom were eligible for evaluation of the relationship between LDL-C and carotid mean-IMT change. In the subanalysis, we evaluated the extent to which intensive lipid-lowering therapy slowed the mean-IMT progression by a correlation analysis between LDL-C and mean-IMT change after 12 months of statin treatment. Nearly half were male (49.4%) and elderly (49.7%). The majority (84.4%) were treated for primary prevention. Patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus accounted for 65.3% and 44.0%, respectively. At the 12-month measurement point, mean-IMT change was correlated with LDL-C (R = 0.187; P = 0.0016), LDL-C/ HDL-C ratio (R = 0.152; P = 0.0105), and non-HDL-C (R = 0.132; P = 0.0259). Mean-IMT after 12 months was divided into 4 subgroups by LDL-C at 12 months; < 80,  80 to < 100,  100 to < 120, and  120 mg/dL. A trend analysis using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test showed statistical signifi cance (P = 0.0002). Even for prevention in Japanese patients who have lower risk of atherosclerotic disease than Western patients, lowering the LDL-C level to below the therapeutic target prevented mean-IMT progression after 12 months more strongly. These findings suggest that more intensive control of LDL-C to levels lower than those in current JAS guidelines should be required to achieve slowing of progression as well as induction of regression of atherosclerosis.

TI  - Increased oxidative stress and coenzyme Q10 deficiency in juvenile fibromyalgia: amelioration of hypercholesterolemia and fatigue by ubiquinol-10 supplementation.
AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by generalized pain and chronic fatigue of unknown etiology. To evaluate the role of oxidative stress in this disorder, we measured plasma levels of ubiquinone-10, ubiquinol-10, free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol esters (CE), and free fatty acids (FFA) in patients with juvenile FM (n=10) and in healthy control subjects (n=67). Levels of FC and CE were significantly increased in juvenile FM as compared with controls, suggesting the presence of hypercholesterolemia in this disease. However, plasma level of ubiquinol-10 was significantly decreased and the ratio of ubiquinone-10 to total coenzyme Q10 (%CoQ10) was significantly increased in juvenile FM relative to healthy controls, suggesting that FM is associated with coenzyme Q10 deficiency and increased oxidative stress. Moreover, plasma level of FFA was significantly higher and the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in total FFA was significantly lower in FM than in controls, suggesting increased tissue oxidative damage in juvenile FM. Interestingly, the content of monoenoic acids, such as oleic and palmitoleic acids, was significantly increased in FM relative to controls, probably to compensate for the loss of PUFA. Next, we examined the effect of ubiquinol-10 supplementation (100 mg/day for 12 weeks) in FM patients. This resulted in an increase in coenzyme Q10 levels and a decrease in %CoQ10. No changes were observed in FFA levels or their composition. However, plasma levels of FC and CE significantly decreased and the ratio of FC to CE also significantly decreased, suggesting that ubiquinol-10 supplementation improved cholesterol metabolism. Ubiquinol-10 supplementation also improved chronic fatigue scores as measured by the Chalder Fatigue Scale.

TI  - A comparison of efficacy and safety of an ezetimibe/simvastatin combination compared with other intensified lipid-lowering treatment strategies in diabetic patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease.
AB  - The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering efficacy of switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin (EZ/S) 10/20 mg versus doubling the run-in statin dose (to simvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg) or switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg in subjects with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes was assessed. Endpoints included percentage change in LDL-C and percentage of patients achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL. Significantly greater reductions in LDL-C occurred when switching to EZ/S versus statin doubling in the overall population and in subjects treated with simvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg (all p < 0.001). The LDL-C reduction was numerically greater when switching to EZ/S versus switching to rosuvastatin (p = 0.060). Significantly more subjects reached LDL-C <70 mg/dL with EZ/S (54.5%) versus statin doubling (27.0%) or rosuvastatin (42.5%) in the overall population (all p < 0.001) and within each stratum (all p < 0.001). Switching to EZ/S provided significantly greater reductions in LDL-C versus statin doubling and significantly greater achievement of LDL-C targets versus statin doubling or switching to rosuvastatin.

TI  - Alteration of relation of atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol to apolipoprotein B by intensive statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome (from the Limiting UNdertreatment of lipids in ACS With Rosuvastatin [LUNAR] Trial).
AB  - The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal of <70 mg/dl, recommended for patients with acute coronary syndrome, typically requires intensive therapy with high-dose statins. The secondary goals of non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol <100 mg/dl and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) <80 mg/dl have been recommended to reduce excess cardiovascular risk not captured by LDL cholesterol. The present post hoc analysis from the Limiting UNdertreatment of lipids in Acute coronary syndrome with Rosuvastatin (LUNAR) study examined the relation of ApoB with LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol at baseline and during treatment with intensive statin therapy. The LUNAR participants had acute coronary syndrome and received rosuvastatin 40 mg/day or 20mg/day or atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 12 weeks. Linear regression analyses were used to compare ApoB, direct LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol at baseline and during therapy. Of the 682 patients included in the analysis, 220 had triglycerides 200 mg/dl. Linear regression analysis showed that correlation of ApoB and non-HDL cholesterol was stronger than that of ApoB and LDL cholesterol and stronger with statin therapy than at baseline (R(2)= 0.93 for ApoB vs non-HDL cholesterol with statins). The target of ApoB of80mg/dl correlated with LDL cholesterol of 90 mg/dl and non-HDL cholesterol of 110mg/dl at baseline and with LDL cholesterol of 74 mg/dl and non-HDL cholesterol of 92mg/dl with statin therapy. For high-triglyceride patients, the corresponding on-treatment targets were LDL cholesterol of 68 mg/dl and non-HDL cholesterol of 92 mg/dl. In conclusion, non-HDL cholesterol is an adequate surrogate of ApoB during statin therapy, independent of triglyceride status. However, to match LDL cholesterol and ApoB treatment goals in the very-high-risk category, the current non-HDL cholesterol goal should be lowered by 8to 10mg/dl.

TI  - -glucans reduce LDL cholesterol in patients with myasthenia gravis.
AB  - We aimed at evaluating whether -glucans could improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and/or glycemic control in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), in whom statins usually have muscle-related side effects. Fifty-nine MG patients participated in the study and received a daily dietary supplement of 3 g of -glucans during 8 weeks. Body mass index (BMI) and blood sample analysis of lipid and glucose status were performed before and after 8 weeks intake of -glucans. In the 52 patients who completed the study, there was a significant reduction in total cholesterol, LDL, ApoA1 and ApoB (all P<0.003). However, glycemic control and BMI were unaltered. The present study indicates that 8 weeks daily intake of 3 g of -glucans significantly reduces total cholesterol, LDL, ApoA1 and ApoB in MG patients. -glucans may therefore be of value in improving lipid status in MG patients, without the muscle-related side effects accompanied by statins.

TI  - Persimmon fruit tannin-rich fiber reduces cholesterol levels in humans.
AB  - Bile acid-binding agents are known to lower blood cholesterol levels and have been clinically used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We previously showed that tannin-rich fiber from young persimmon (Diospyros kaki) fruits had bile acid-binding properties. In this study, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the hypocholesterolemic effects of tannin-rich fiber in humans. The subjects (n = 40, plasma total cholesterol levels 180-259 mg/dl) were divided into 3 groups and ingested cookie bars containing 0 g (placebo group, n = 14), 3 g (low-dose group, n = 13), or 5 g (high-dose group, n = 13) of tannin-rich fiber 3 times daily before meals for 12 weeks. Plasma total cholesterol levels decreased significantly in the low-dose (12 weeks, p < 0.005) and high-dose (6 weeks, p < 0.05; 12 weeks, p < 0.001) groups. In addition, plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly in the high-dose group (6 weeks, p < 0.05; 12 weeks, p < 0.001). These improvements were not accompanied by changes in plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or plasma triglyceride levels. Our findings indicate that tannin-rich fiber from young persimmon fruits is a useful food material for treating hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Cholesterol-lowering efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum CECT 7527, 7528 and 7529 in hypercholesterolaemic adults.
AB  - Previous studies have indicated that supplementation with probiotic bacteria may improve lipid metabolism. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of a mixture of three strains of Lactobacillus plantarum (CECT 7527, CECT 7528 and CECT 7529) on cholesterol-lowering efficacy in hypercholesterolaemic patients. A total of sixty volunteers (thirty participants in the placebo group and thirty counterparts in the L. plantarum group), aged 1865 years old, participated in a controlled, randomised, double-blind trial. The study group received one capsule daily containing 12  10(9) colony-forming units of Lactobacillus strains in a unique dose; the placebo group consumed the same product without bacteria for 12 weeks. A significant reduction of 136 % in plasma total cholesterol (TC) levels was observed after 12 weeks of consumption in the L. plantarum group when compared with the placebo group. The lipidic outcomes were also analysed based on TC values at baseline: low initial values (LIV, 2000-2500 mg/l) v. high initial values (HIV, 25103000 mg/l). In the HIV group, the L. plantarum treatment showed a reduction after 12 weeks of consumption compared with the placebo group in TC, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and oxidised LDL-C (174, 176 and 156 %, respectively). In the LIV, the L. plantarum treatment only showed a reduction after 12 weeks of consumption when compared with the placebo group in TC (94 %). The present results showed that the biofunctionality of L. plantarum (CECT 7527, CECT 7528 and CECT 7529) is proportional to the cardiovascular risk of the patient, having a better effect in patients with higher levels of cholesterol.

TI  - Niacin administration significantly reduces oxidative stress in patients with hypercholesterolemia and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
AB  - Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders, including atherosclerosis. In pharmacological doses, niacin (vitamin B3) was proven to reduce total cholesterol, triglyceride, very-low-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein levels, and to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of niacin treatment in patients with low levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C; <40 mg%) on their lipid profile and oxidative stress status. Seventeen patients with hypercholesterolemia and low HDL-C and 8 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. The patients were treated with niacin for 12 weeks. Lipid profile, oxidative stress and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined at the time of enrollment, and 2 and 12 weeks after initiation of niacin treatment. Subjects with lower HDL-C levels exhibited higher oxidative stress compared with subjects with normal HDL-C levels. Niacin treatment in hypercholesterolemic patients caused a significant increase in HDL-C and apolipoprotein A1 levels, and a decrease in triglyceride levels. Niacin also significantly reduced oxidative stress, as measured by a significant decrease in the serum content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid peroxides and paraoxonase activity, compared with the levels before treatment. Although serum CRP levels were not affected by niacin treatment, a correlation between CRP and HDL levels was obtained when computing the results. Niacin treatment in hypercholesterolemic patients with low HDL levels caused a significant decrease in their oxidative stress status. These results indicate an additional beneficial effect of niacin beyond its ability to affect the lipid profile.

TI  - Differences in synthesis and absorption of cholesterol of two effective lipid-lowering therapies.
AB  - Effective statin therapy is associated with a marked reduction of cardiovascular events. However, the explanation for full benefits obtained for LDL cholesterol targets by combined lipid-lowering therapy is controversial. Our study compared the effects of two equally effective lipid-lowering strategies on markers of cholesterol synthesis and absorption. A prospective, open label, randomized, parallel design study, with blinded endpoints, included 116 subjects. We compared the effects of a 12-week treatment with 40 mg rosuvastatin or the combination of 40 mg simvastatin/10 mg ezetimibe on markers of cholesterol absorption (campesterol and -sitosterol), synthesis (desmosterol), and their ratios to cholesterol. Both therapies similarly decreased total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B, and increased apolipoprotein A1 (P < 0.05 vs baseline for all). Simvastatin/ezetimibe increased plasma desmosterol (P = 0.012 vs baseline), and decreased campesterol and -sitosterol (P < 0.0001 vs baseline for both), with higher desmosterol (P = 0.007) and lower campesterol and -sitosterol compared to rosuvastatin, (P < 0.0001, for both). In addition, rosuvastatin increased the ratios of these markers to cholesterol (P < 0.002 vs baseline for all), whereas simvastatin/ezetimibe significantly decreased the campesterol/cholesterol ratio (P = 0.008 vs baseline) and tripled the desmosterol/cholesterol ratio (P < 0.0001 vs baseline). The campesterol/cholesterol and -sitosterol/cholesterol ratios were lower, whereas the desmosterol/cholesterol ratio was higher in patients receiving simvastatin/ezetimibe (P < 0.0001 vs rosuvastatin, for all). Pronounced differences in markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis were observed between two equally effective lipid-lowering strategies.

TI  - Beneficial effects of artichoke leaf extract supplementation on increasing HDL-cholesterol in subjects with primary mild hypercholesterolaemia: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of artichoke leaf extract (ALE) supplementation (250 mg, 2 b.i.d.) on the lipid pattern. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 92 overweight subjects with primary mild hypercholesterolaemia for 8 weeks. Forty-six subjects were randomized to supplementation (age: 54.2  6.6 years, body mass index (BMI): 25.8  3.9 kg/m(2), male/female: 20/26) and 46 subjects to placebo (age: 53.8  9.0 years, BMI: 24.8  1.6 kg/m(2), male/female: 21/25). Verum supplementation was associated with a significant increase in mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (p < 0.001) and in mean change in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) (p = 0.004). A significantly decreased difference was also found for the mean change in total cholesterol (p = 0.033), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (p < 0.001), total cholesterol/HDL ratio (p < 0.001) and LDL/HDL ratio (p < 0.001), when verum and placebo treatment were compared. These results indicate that ALE could play a relevant role in the management of mild hypercholesterolaemia, favouring in particular the increase in HDL-C, besides decreasing total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.

TI  - Design and rationale of the LAPLACE-TIMI 57 trial: a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and tolerability of a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of PCSK9 in subjects with hypercholesterolemia on background statin therapy.
AB  - Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a cornerstone for the prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease, improving clinical outcomes and reducing vascular mortality in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The clinical benefits of LDL-C reduction appear to extend even to patients starting with LDL-C as low as 60-80 mg/dL prior to initiating therapy. Statins are the first-line agents for treating hypercholesterolemia and are effective in reducing LDL-C, but many patients are unable to achieve their optimal lipid targets despite intensive statin therapy. Therefore, there has been a strong impetus for the development of novel pharmacologic agents designed to lower LDL-C further in patients already on statin therapy. Genetic mutations resulting in altered cholesterol homeostasis provide valuable information regarding novel approaches for treating hypercholesterolemia. To that end, mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) were linked to altered levels of LDL-C, illustrating this protein's role in lipid metabolism. PCSK9 promotes degradation of the LDL receptor, preventing its transport back to the cell surface and thereby increasing circulating LDL-C. Conversely, inhibition of PCSK9 can profoundly decrease circulating LDL-C, and thus is an attractive new target for LDL-C-lowering therapy. AMG 145 is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 antibody that binds specifically to human PCSK9 and inhibits its interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor. In this manuscript, we describe the rationale and design of LDL-C Assessment with PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibody Inhibition Combined With Statin Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 57 (LAPLACE-TIMI 57; NCT01380730), a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of AMG 145 when added to statin therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Influence of atorvastatin on serum amyloid A-low density lipoprotein complex in hypercholesterolemic patients.
AB  - The complex of serum amyloid A(SAA) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), SAA-LDL, is considered a new and unique marker of oxidatively-modified LDL particles, which is associated with atherosclerotic conditions. This study investigated the influence of atorvastatin treatment on circulating SAA-LDL levels among asymptomatic hypercholesterolemic patients. A total of 26 patients (mean age 63 years) received 10 mg/daily atorvastatin during a 12-week treatment period. The levels of LDL cholesterol and SAA-LDL, but not high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and SAA, were significantly reduced after the treatment. Stepwise adjusted regression analyses revealed that changes of SAA-LDL were significantly and positively correlated with those of SAA, while absolute changes were small, which warrants further investigation. The results suggest that atorvastatin may beneficially reduce SAA-LDL, and SAA-LDL may be a sensitive measure for monitoring the efficacy and antioxidant functions of atorvastatin.

TI  - [Achievement of therapeutic target in subjects on statin treatment in clinical practice. Results of the STAR (Statins Target Assessment in Real practice) study].
AB  - The primary aim of the STAR Study (Statins Target Assessment in Real practice) was to determine the LDL-cholesterol reduction and to analyse patient's and therapeutic factors associated to LDL-cholesterol target attainment in newly treated subjects with statins in an unselected population in clinical practice setting. Administrative databases (including pharmaceutical prescriptions and hospital admissions) and laboratory test databases (including LDL-cholesterol values) of five local health units, distributed in Emilia Romagna, Toscana and Umbria, were linked. A retrospective cohort study was conducted and all subjects aged > or =18 years with a first prescription for statins (newly treated subjects) between January 1st, 2007 and June 30th, 2008 were included. All statin prescriptions over a 12 months follow-up period were considered and used to calculate adherence to treatment. Baseline and follow-up LDL-cholesterol, respectively, were defined according to the nearest determination to the first prescription for statins and to the end of the follow-up period. A total of 3.232 subjects was included, 1.516 males (47%) and 1.716 females (53%), with an average age equal to 65.9 +/- 11.3 years. Among included subjects, 22.,6% had a gap to LDL-cholesterol target <10%, 30.0% between 10 and 29%, 20.7% between 30 and 49%, and 26.7% . or =50%. Among those with a gap to target > or =50%, 30-49%, and 10-29%, respectively, LDL-cholesterol target was attained by 7.1%, 41.8%, and 62.% of subjects. LDL-cholesterol target attainment was associated to gap to target, adherence with treatment, and type of statin.

AB  - A significant number of human clinical trials have reported no adverse effects associated with consumption of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri). In the present study, the clinical safety and toxicology of oral ingestion of supplement capsules containing L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 was investigated. A randomized group of 131 subjects received a dose of 2.910 CFU L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 capsules (n=67) or placebo capsules (n=64) twice daily for 9 weeks. Clinical chemistry and hematological parameters of safety were analyzed. The frequency, duration and intensity of adverse events (AE)s and clinical significance of safety parameters were recorded for both groups. No clinically significant differences between the probiotic capsule and placebo capsule treated groups were detected in either the blood clinical chemistry or hematology results. The frequency and intensity of AEs was similar in the two groups. These results demonstrate that administration of a twice daily dose of 2.910 CFU was safe and well tolerated in the population evaluated over 9 weeks.

TI  - Powdered red yeast rice and plant stanols and sterols to lower cholesterol.
AB  - Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is estimated that 42% of females and 34% of males in the USA have elevated total cholesterol. The current mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy utilizes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (i.e., statin) medications that lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by an average of 20% and 28%, respectively. However, due to the significant side effects of statin medications, many patients seek alternative therapies to help manage their hypercholesterolemia. Red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) has been used as a food and as an herbal medication in China for centuries. Phytosterols are foods that are similar in structure and function to animal cholesterol. Both of these compounds have been shown in clinical studies to significantly lower LDL cholesterol. We report on a case series of 18 patients with hypercholesterolemia despite therapeutic lifestyle change through diet and exercise who took a proprietary product combining red yeast rice and phytosterols as a powdered shake in an effort to improve their cholesterol indices. Statistically significant reduction (p < .05) in the following mean variables was seen: total cholesterol 19% (46 mg/dL) and LDL 33% (53 mg/dL) after 6 weeks using the blend. There was no significant difference in body mass index (BMI), triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the same period. This magnitude of reduction in LDL cholesterol is significantly greater than the 28% reduction observed in the 1999 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) meta-analysis on the average effectiveness of statin medications in lowering cholesterol levels. None of the participants in our study reported any muscle pains, and no abnormal liver function tests were seen while taking the product. Though this case series is limited by small sample size, study duration, and lack of control group, the product's significant reduction in LDL cholesterol without severe side effects indicates that this product may be a clinically effective and well tolerated alternative treatment to using statin medications to treat hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Rosuvastatin improves pulse wave reflection by restoring endothelial function.
AB  - One of the major indicators of intact endothelial function is basal nitric oxide (NO) activity. Further, it seems to be likely that statin therapy exerts beneficial effects on vascular function, at least in part via an improvement of NO bioavailability. In the present double-blind crossover study 29 hypercholesterolemic patients were randomly assigned to receive rosuvastatin and placebo for 42days. Pulse wave analysis was assessed after 30min of rest (baseline) and after infusion of N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) at the end of 42days treatment period. The magnitude of the increase in central augmentation index (cAIx) in response to inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) by l-NMMA is indicative of basal NO activity. CAIx was significantly lower (18.310 versus 21.912%, p=0.027) with rosuvastatin compared to placebo. There was no increment of cAIx in response to l-NMMA in placebo group. In contrast, cAIx increased significantly in response to l-NMMA (20.511 versus 25.710mm Hg, p=0.001) in rosuvastatin group. The percentage of increase of cAIx tended to be more pronounced after treatment with rosuvastatin compared to placebo (53.792 versus 14.136%, p=0.087). Pulse pressure amplification (PPA) improved (1.310.2 versus 1.260.2%, p=0.016) after rosuvastatin compared to placebo. Regression analyses revealed that both LDL-cholesterol and CRP-levels are independent determinants of basal NO activity improvement, which itself is an independent determinant of vascular function, expressed by an improvement of pulse wave reflection and PPA. In this placebo controlled study, treatment with rosuvastatin improved vascular and endothelial function. Determinants for improved NO production in patients with hypercholesterolemia were the achieved levels of LDL-cholesterol and CRP. Overall, in patients without CV disease, rosuvastatin exerted beneficially effect on vascular dysfunction, one of the earliest manifestation of atherosclerosis.

AB  - This study examined the concordance between multiple measures of adherence, as well as sensitivity to detection of poor adherers, specificity, and predictive validity using a daily cholesterol-lowering regimen. Participants (N = 180) aged 24 to 60 years participated in an adherence ancillary study in a clinical trial. Males constituted 53.9% of this well-educated, community sample. Data on adherence were collected over a 6-month period, using electronic monitoring, self-report, specific recall, and pill counts. Electronically monitored (odds ratio [OR] = 5.348) and Shea self-report (OR = 2.678) predicted cholesterol lowering. Days (78.9%) and intervals (84.2%) adherent and the Shea (73.7%) were sensitive to the detection of poor adherers. Moderate associations were found between measures of the same type. Low correlations were found otherwise. The electronic monitor was the most accurate and informative measure. The Shea self-report was the most accurate brief, global estimate of adherence. Other measures were not associated with clinical outcome or sensitive to poor adherence.

TI  - Drinking deep seawater decreases serum total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic subjects.
AB  - Drinking deep seawater (DSW) with high levels of magnesium (Mg) decreased serum lipids in animal studies. Therefore the effects of drinking DSW on blood lipids and its antioxidant capacity in hypercholesterolemic subjects were investigated. DSW was first prepared by a process of filtration and reverse osmosis, and then the concentrated DSW with high levels of Mg was diluted as drinking DSW. Forty-two hypercholesterolemic volunteers were randomly divided into three groups: reverse osmotic (RO) water, DSW (Mg: 395mg/L, hardness 1410ppm), and magnesium-chloride fortified (MCF) water (Mg: 386mg/L, hardness 1430ppm). The subjects drank 1050mL of water daily for 6 weeks, and blood samples were collected and analyzed on weeks 0, 3, and 6. Drinking DSW caused a decrease in blood total cholesterol levels and this effect was progressively enhanced with time. Serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) was also decreased by DSW. Further, total cholesterol levels of subjects in the DSW group were significantly lower than those in the MCF water or RO water groups. Compared with week 0, the DSW group had higher blood Mg level on weeks 3 and 6, but the Mg levels were within the normal range in all three groups. DSW consumption also lowered thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) values in serum. In conclusion, DSW was apparently effective in reducing blood total cholesterol and LDL-C, and also in decreasing lipid peroxidation in hypercholesterolemic subjects.

TI  - Impact of efavirenz on intestinal metabolism and transport: insights from an interaction study with ezetimibe in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Hypercholesterolemia frequently occurs in patients treated with efavirenz who cannot be treated adequately with statins because of drug interactions. These patients may benefit from cholesterol-lowering therapy with ezetimibe. This study determined the influence of single-dose and multiple-dose efavirenz (400 mg/day for 9 days) on the pharmacokinetics and sterol-lowering of ezetimibe (10 mg) in 12 healthy subjects. In addition, the influence of efavirenz on genome-wide intestinal expression and in vitro function of ABCB1, ABCC2, UGT1A1, and OATP1B1 was studied. Efavirenz (multiple dose) had no influence on the pharmacokinetics and lipid-lowering functions of ezetimibe. Intestinal expression of enzymes and transporters (e.g., ABCB1, ABCC2, and UGT1A1) was not affected by chronic efavirenz. Efavirenz (single dose) slightly increased ezetimibe absorption and markedly decreased exposure to ezetimibe-glucuronide (single dose and multiple dose), which may be explained by inhibition of UGT1A1 and ABCB1 (in vitro data). Ezetimibe had no effect on the disposition of efavirenz. Consequently, ezetimibe may be a safe and efficient therapeutic option in patients with HIV infection.

We enrolled 28 patients with type 2 diabetes complicated by dyslipidemia who had been treated with statins for at least one year. The patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: administration of statin alone (group S: n = 13) and addition of EPA to the current statin therapy (group SE: n = 15). The highly purified EPA was administered at a dose of 1,800 mg/day for 6 months. To evaluate vascular function, the duration of reactive hyperemia (DRH), which is the time required for forearm blood flow to return to the basal level after inducing reactive hyperemia, was measured using strain gauge plethysmography. There were no significant differences in the clinical background factors between the 2 groups. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly decreased after 6 months only in group SE. Compared with the baseline data, no significant change in DRH was observed after 6 months in group S. By contrast, DRH was significantly prolonged after 6 months in group SE, indicating that the addition of highly purified EPA improved vascular function. Our results showed that in patients with type 2 diabetes and receiving statin therapy whose LDL-C level was less than 100 mg/dL, the addition of highly purified EPA for 6 months significantly improved vascular function.

TI  - Oxidative stress improvement is associated with increased levels of taurine in CKD patients undergoing lipid-lowering therapy.
AB  - Lipid-lowering therapy has been reported to reduce several oxidative stress (OS) markers in hypercholesterolemia. Since OS is frequently associated with renal dysfunction, we aimed to investigate the effect of hypolipidemic drugs on oxidative stress and plasma taurine (Tau), a sulfur amino acid with a marked antioxidant effect, in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We enrolled 30 CKD randomized to receive three different hypolipidemic regimens for 12 months: simvastatin alone (40 mg/day) or ezetimibe/simvastatin combined therapy (10/20 or 10/40 mg/day). Low molecular weight (LMW) thiols including homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine, glutathione, and glutamylcysteine in their reduced and total form and oxidative stress indices as malondialdehyde (MDA) and allantoin/uric acid (All/UA) ratio were also evaluated. Tau concentration significantly increased throughout the therapy. The rise of taurine was more striking for the group with the concomitant administration of ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg/day (+31.6% after 1 year of therapy). A significant decrease of both MDA and All/UA ratio was observed during therapy for all patients (-19% for both MDA and All/UA ratio) with a more pronounced effect in patients treated with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg/day (-26% for MDA and -28% for All/UA ratio). Besides, an increase of thiols reduced forms was found (+20.7% of LMW thiols redox status) with a greater effect in subjects treated with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg/day (+24.7%). Moreover, we demonstrated that oxidative stress improvement during therapy was correlated with increased taurine levels. We hypothesize that taurine may be responsible for the oxidative stress improvement observed during lipid-lowering treatment through the reduction of superoxide anion production at the respiratory chain activity level.

TI  - [Effect of sacha inchi oil (plukenetia volbilis l) on the lipid profile of patients with hyperlipoproteinemia].
AB  - We performed a pilot, experimental, open study in order to know the effect, effective dosage and secondary effects of sacha inchis (Plukenetia Huallabamba) [corrected] oil on the lipid profiles of patients with hypercholesterolemia. We included 24 patients of ages 35 to 75, to whom we measured total cholesterol (TC), HDL, triglycerides (Tg), glucose (G), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and insulin (I) levels in blood, then we randomized them to receive sacha inchi oil orally 5 ml or 10 ml of a suspension of sacha inchi oil (2gr/5ml) for four months. The oil intake produced a decrease in the mean values of TC, and NEFA, and a rise in HDL in both subgroups. The subgroup receiving 10 ml was associated to an increase in the insulin levels. Sacha inchi oil appears to have beneficial effects on the lipid profile of patients with dyslipidemia, but their efficacy and security should be evaluated in randomized clinical trials.

TI  - Anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypercholesterolemic effects of Aloe vera leaf gel in hyperlipidemic type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  - Diabetes mellitus type 2 with dyslipidemia is a common disease. Previous studies suggest that aloe (Aloe vera L.) leaf gel may positively affect the blood glucose and lipid levels in dyslipidemic type 2 diabetic patients. Thus, in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with hyperlipidemic (hypercholesterolemic and/or hypertriglyceridemic) type 2 diabetic patients aged 40 to 60 years not using other anti-hyperlipidemic agents and resistant to daily intake of two 5 mg glyburide tablets and two 500 mg metformin tablets, the efficacy and safety of taking aloe gel (one 300 mg capsule every 12 hours for 2 months) combined with the aforementioned drugs in treatment of 30 patients were evaluated and compared with the placebo group (n = 30). The aloe gel lowered the fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and LDL levels significantly (p = 0.036, p = 0.036, p = 0.006, and p = 0.004, respectively) without any significant effects on the other blood lipid levels and liver/kidney function tests (p > 0.05) compared with the placebo at the endpoint. No adverse effects were reported. The results suggest that aloe gel may be a safe anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hypercholesterolemic agent for hyperlipidemic type 2 diabetic patients.

TI  - KIF6, LPA, TAS2R50, and VAMP8 genetic variation, low density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering response to pravastatin, and heart disease risk reduction in the elderly.
AB  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the KIF6 (kinesin like protein 6, rs20455 or 719Arg), LPA (lipoprotein(a), rs3798220), TAS2R50 (taste receptor type 2, member 50, rs1376251) and VAMP8 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 8, rs1010) have previously been associated with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering response to statins, coronary heart disease (CHD) at baseline, or CHD events on trial. We examined SNPs at the KIF6 (rs20455 or 719Arg), LPA (rs3798220), TAS2R50 (rs1376251) and VAMP8 (rs1010) in 5,411 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and were followed for a mean of 3.2 years. No SNP was related to vascular disease at baseline. Only the KIF6 SNP was related to LDL-C lowering with homozygous Arg 719 subjects being significantly less responsive than other groups (p=0.025, -34.2 vs. -36.1%). With regard to the primary CHD endpoint on trial (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke), we observed a significant relationship for KIF6 719Arg homozygotes (p=0.03, hazards ratio 0.47, 12.8% of the population) in women on pravastatin only, and for TAS2R50 for the AA genotype (p=0.03, hazards ratio 1.76, 8.9% of the population), also only in women on pravastatin. Our data indicate that the assessment of KIF6 rs20455 and TAS2R50 rs1376251 genotypes are not useful for predicting statin induced cardiovascular risk reduction in men, but do predict CHD risk reduction in women in this elderly population. However, these differences are no longer significant after correction for multiple comparisons, and we do not recommend the assessment of any of these SNPs in clinical practice.

TI  - Genetic variation at the SLCO1B1 gene locus and low density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering response to pravastatin in the elderly.
AB  - Our goal was to determine whether genetic variation at genes affecting statin metabolism or targets of statin therapy would influence low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering with pravastatin, baseline heart disease, or cardiac endpoints on trial. We examined associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the liver X receptor alpha (LXRA, rs12221497), and the solute carrier organic anion transporter (SLCO1B1, rs4149056 and rs2306283) gene loci with these variables. We studied 5411 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and were followed for a mean of 3.2 years. No relationships between genetic variation at the LXRA gene locus with statin induced LDL lowering response or other parameters were noted. Both the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (valine for alanine at 174) and the rs2306283 (asparagine for aspartic acid at 130) SNPs affect the amino acid sequence of the SLCO1B1 gene product. No effect of the rs2306283 SNP on any of the variables was noted. However the presence of the rs4149056 SNP was associated with significantly less LDL cholesterol lowering response to pravastatin (wildtype, 71.5% of the population, -37.0%; heterozygotes, 25.8% of the population, -36.0%; and homozygotes, 2.7% of the population, -31.8%, p=0.003 at 6 months, and p=0.022 at 12 months). Our data indicate that the presence of the rs4149056 non-synonymous SNP at the SLCO1B1 gene locus can significantly decrease the pravastatin induced LDL cholesterol lowering response.

TI  - Effect of altering dietary n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio on cardiovascular risk measures in patients treated with statins: a pilot study.
AB  - Increasing dietary n-3 PUFA decreases the risk of CHD. Since n-6 PUFA compete with n-3 PUFA for common metabolic enzymes, the n-6:n-3 ratio intake rather than the n-3 PUFA intake levels per se may be critical. We aimed to examine whether altering the n-6:n-3 ratio affects cardiovascular risk factors in hypercholesterolaemic patients on lipid management with statins. Adhering to a randomised, crossover study design, patients on statins (n 11) were placed on one of two dietary interventions (Diet high-ratio (HR) - n-6:n-3=30:1 or Diet low-ratio (LR) - n-6:n-3=17:1) for 4 weeks followed after an 8-week washout period by the alternate diet. Foods enriched with n-3 or n-6 PUFA were delivered to each patient, who were given clear guidance on consumption expectations for the study. Measures of lipid profile, blood pressure and vascular function were determined. Diet LR significantly reduced body weight, LDL-cholesterol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, blood pressure and the apoA-1:apoB ratio. While Diet HR trended towards a similar cardioprotective profile, most of the parameters examined did not reach statistical significance. A direct comparison between diets demonstrated no significant superiority of Diet LR over Diet HR. These results suggest that a dietary intervention focused on n-6 and n-3 fatty acids may improve cardiovascular risk factors in patients over and above standard lipid management, but there is no significant advantage of a low n-6:n-3 ratio diet when compared to a high-ratio diet.

TI  - Influence of ezetimibe monotherapy on ischemia-modified albumin levels in hypercholesterolemic patients.
AB  - Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is considered to be a novel biochemical marker for ischemic and atherosclerotic conditions. This study aimed to investigate the influence of ezetimibe monotherapy on circulating IMA levels in hypercholesterolemic patients. A total of 31 patients (mean age 65.7 years) received 10 mg of ezetimibe daily during a 12-week treatment period. The levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and IMA were significantly reduced after ezetimibe treatment. The adjusted regression analyses revealed that the changes in the IMA levels were not significantly correlated with those of the other atherosclerotic risk markers, such as body mass index, blood pressure, glucose and lipid panels. The significant reduction of the IMA levels following ezetimibe treatment, which was independent of the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, suggests that ezetimibe may improve the oxidative stress burden in hypercholesterolemic patients.

TI  - Assessment of atorvastatin effectiveness on serum PSA level in hypercholesterolemic males.
AB  - The previous large retrospective studies demonstrated that treatment with Statins reduces both the incidence of prostate cancer by 50% and serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level up to 40%. However the main problem in those studies was the absence of control groups of men with hypercholesterolemia without Statin treatment. We performed a small prospective controlled clinical trial to assess the influence of the treatment with Atorvastatin on serum PSA in men with hypercholesterolemia referred to our educational and treatment center from October 2007 to March 2008. In this study, among the newly diagnosed males with hypercholesterolemia (LDL > 130 mg/dl), 40 patients with LDL more than 190 mg/dl were selected as a case group and were treated with Atorvastatin (20 mg/day). Among the same population and in the same period, another 40 patients with LDL between 130 and 190 mg/dl were selected as first control group and were treated only with low fat diet. Another 40 patients with normal serum cholesterol and without any treatment were selected as second control group. The lipid profile and serum PSA level of patients of all groups were tested at the first and third months after the therapy. After completion of data, the mean serum lipids and PSA level were measured in both visits and compared with each other by paired t-test. Also the mean PSA change in two visits between three groups was compared by ANOVA and Tukey HSD test. There was not any significant difference in mean baseline PSA between hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemic patients (P=0.547). In case group, mean PSA and LDL was reduced by 14.1% (P=0.0001) and 30% (P=0.0001) respectively by second visit. In first control group, mean PSA was not changed significantly (P=0.337), whereas mean LDL in this group was reduced by 9.6% (P= 0.0001). Similarly in the second control group mean PSA was not changed significantly (P=0.309) by second visit. In addition, mean change of PSA in case group was compared with first and second control groups that was significantly different (P=0.0001) whereas mean change of PSA between two control groups was not significantly different (P=0.615). The results of this study showed that: 1) Short term treatment with Atorvastatin can reduce serum PSA level, and 2) This reduction is more likely to be due to direct effect and is not related to lowering serum cholesterol levels. Thus, if results of this study are confirmed by large prospective randomized clinical trials with longer follow up period, it will be possible that Atorvastatin could be used in long term as a safe chemoprophylactic agent against prostate cancer in high risk patients.

TI  - Gender differences in cholesterol-lowering medication prescribing in peripheral artery disease.
AB  - Among 320 patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels > 70 mg/dl, we determined whether male sex, higher education, and greater self-efficacy for willingness to request therapy from one's physician were associated with increases in LDL-C-lowering medication and achievement of an LDL-C level < 70 mg/dl at 1-year follow-up. Participants were enrolled in a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether a telephone counseling intervention can help PAD patients achieve an LDL-C level < 70 mg/dl, compared to usual care and attention control conditions, respectively. Adjusting for age, race, comorbidities, PAD severity, and other covariates, male sex (odds ratio = 3.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.64 to 6.77, p = 0.001) was associated with a higher likelihood of adding cholesterol-lowering medication during follow-up, but was not associated with achieving an LDL-C < 70 mg/dl (odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 0.55 to 2.18). No associations of education level or self-efficacy with study outcomes were identified. In conclusion, male PAD patients with baseline LDL-C levels  70 mg/dl were more likely to intensify LDL-C-lowering medication during 1-year follow-up than female PAD patients. Despite greater increases in LDL-C-lowering medication among female PAD patients, there was no difference in the degree of LDL-C lowering during the study between men and women with PAD.

Eighty five patients who received 10mg or 20 mg of atorvastatin for 8 weeks depending on target cholesterol goal were followed up by their own physicians and had final evaluation at 52 weeks. Reduction in mean low density Lipoprotein (LDL-C) was 36.5%, 37.9% and 32.2% at weeks 4, 8 and 52 respectively. LDL-C target was maintained in 81% and 69% of patients at week 8 and 52 respectively without drug related serious adverse events. Generic atorvastatin is safe and effective in usual clinical care setting.

AB  - Research of statin influence on asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) reveals controversial results. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate (40mg) and high (80mg) simvastatin doses on the levels of ADMA, total homocysteine (tHcy) and %FMD in patients with newly diagnosed severe hypercholesterolemia, after optimizing the LDL level. The study included 650 patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol7.5mmol/l; LDL4.9mmol/l). The treatment groups were administered 80mg simvastatin over a period of one month. The results indicated a reduction in ADMA and tHcy levels and an increase in %FMD in the treatment groups, compared with the control groups (receiving placebo or 40mg simvastatin). There was a statistically significant correlation between the %FMD changes and the baseline levels of Apo-B, ADMA and tHcy, as well as between the %ADMA changes and %LDL, % apolipoprotein-B and %tHcy-changes in patients on 80mg Simvastatin. A statistical linear regression analysis (in the treatment group) indicated that the baseline ADMA level is the most important statistically significant predictor related to %FMD-changes. A linear regression analysis additionally documented that % apolipoprotein-B-changes is a predictor of %ADMA-changes. In conclusion, in cases with optimized LDL-target levels (patients on 80mg Simvastatin), the baseline level of ADMA appears to be a major modulator of %FMD-changes.

TI  - Atorvastatin and hormone therapy effects on APOE mRNA expression in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women.
AB  - Menopause is associated with changes in lipid levels resulting in increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Hormone therapy (HT) and atorvastatin have been used to improve lipid profile in postmenopausal women. Effects of HT, atorvastatin and APOE polymorphisms on serum lipids and APOE and LXRA expression were evaluated in 87 hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women, randomly selected for treatment with atorvastatin (AT, n=17), estrogen or estrogen plus progestagen (HT, n=34) and estrogen or estrogen plus progestagen associated with atorvastatin (HT+AT, n=36). RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mRNA expression was measured by TaqMan() PCR. APOE 2/3/4 genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP. Total cholesterol (TC), LDL-c and apoB were reduced after each treatment (p<0.001). Triglycerides, VLDL-c and apoAI were reduced only after atorvastatin (p<0.05), whereas triglycerides and VLDL-c were increased after HT (p=0.01). HT women had lower reduction on TC, LDL-c and apoB than AT and HT+AT groups (p<0.05). APOE mRNA expression was reduced after atorvastatin treatment (p=0.03). Although LXRA gene expression was not modified by atorvastatin, it was correlated with APOE mRNA before and after treatments. Basal APOE mRNA expression was not influenced by gene polymorphisms, however the reduction on APOE expression was more pronounced in 33 than in 34 carriers. Atorvastatin down-regulates APOE mRNA expression and it is modified by APOE genotypes in PBMC from postmenopausal women.

TI  - Lipid-altering effects of a dietary supplement tablet containing free plant sterols and stanols in men and women with primary hypercholesterolaemia: a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial.
AB  - This randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial assessed the lipid-altering efficacy of a dietary supplement (tablet form) providing 1.8g/day free (non-esterified) plant sterols and stanols versus placebo for 6 weeks as part of a therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) diet in 32 men and women with primary hypercholesterolaemia. MeanSE baseline (end of a 5-week TLC diet lead-in) lipid concentrations (mmol/l) were total cholesterol (TC), 5.880.08; non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), 4.710.09; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 4.020.08; HDL-C, 1.170.06 and triglycerides (TGs), 1.510.12. Differences from control in responses (plant sterol/stanol-control) were significant (p<0.05) for LDL-C (-4.9%), non-HDL-C (-3.6%) and TC (-2.8%). HDL-C and TG responses were not significantly different between treatment conditions. These results indicate that 1.8g/day free plant sterols/stanols administered in a tablet produced favourable lipoprotein lipid changes in men and women with hypercholesterolaemia.

AB  - This report describes the lipid and safety data collected during an off-drug period that followed 8 weeks of treatment with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor, anacetrapib (ANA). A total of 589 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed hyperlipidemia were randomized to placebo, atorvastatin (ATV) 20 mg, and varying doses of ANA, provided as monotherapy or coadministered with ATV 20 mg daily. Patients were treated for 8 weeks, followed by an 8-week follow-up period, during which ANA was switched to placebo. At week 16 (8 weeks after ANA was stopped), persistent reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were evident for the monotherapy groups receiving ANA 150 and 300 mg (-9.3% and -15.3%, respectively), and residual increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were observed for the monotherapy groups receiving ANA 40 mg (18.6%), 150 mg (40.5%), and 300 mg (43.4%). The effects on apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-I were consistent with the changes observed for LDL-C and HDL-C, respectively. Corresponding residual changes in LDL-C and HDL-C were also noted in the ATV coadministration groups at the similar doses of ANA compared with ATV 20 mg alone. Residual plasma drug levels accompanied by reductions in cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity were observed at week 16 and may account for the alterations in plasma lipids 8 weeks after cessation of ANA.

AB  - In this study, the effects of simvastatin on the blood pressure and on the antihypertensive activity of ramipril in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals and patients were evaluated. In hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals, repeated administration of simvastatin slightly but significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure, enhanced its progressive reductions induced by repeated administration of ramipril and corrected the compromised lipid profile. Concomitantly, repeated administration of simvastatin, ramipril or simvastatin in combination with ramipril to these animals, increased nitric oxide (NO) production and decreased the elevated serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. The effects of combined treatment were greater than those of simvastatin or ramipril alone. In hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients, repeated administration of ramipril decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increased NO production, and decreased the elevated serum MDA and hs-CRP levels. Addition of simvastatin to ramipril therapy enhanced these effects and corrected the compromised lipid profile. Simvastatin but not ramipril inhibited the contractile responses of isolated aortic rings induced by angiotensin 11. l-arginine and acetylcholine enhanced, while l-NAME inhibited effects of simvastatin, and simvastatin in combination with ramipril on these contractile responses. These findings suggest that simvastatin exerts antihypertensive effect and enhances the antihypertensive effect of ramipril in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals and patients. In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effect, the ability of simvastatin to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction through increasing NO bioavailability and through suppression of oxidative stress and vascular inflammation and its ability to enhance the effect of ramipril on these parameters may play a pivotal role in these effects.

TI  - Low-dose atorvastatin reduces ambulatory blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - Among several beneficial cardiovascular actions of statins, experimental studies have suggested that statins may also induce a mild blood pressure (BP) reduction. However, clinical data were controversial and the potential hypotensive statin effect remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on ambulatory BP in patients with mild hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. A total of 50 patients with mild hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia participated in this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to either 10 mg atorvastatin or placebo for 26 weeks. Background antihypertensive treatment, if any, remained unchanged during follow-up. At baseline and study-end (26 weeks), ambulatory BP monitoring and blood sampling for determination of standard biochemical and safety parameters were performed in all participants. BP loads were defined as the percentage of BP measurements exceeding the hypertension threshold of 140/90 mmHg for daytime and 125/75 mmHg nighttime period. Atorvastatin significantly reduced 24-h systolic and diastolic BP (DBP; median (range)) as compared with placebo (-5.0 (-21.0, 4.0) vs +1.0 (-6.0, 7.0) mmHg, P<0.001 and -3.0 (-16.0, 2.0) vs +0.1 (-7, 4) mmHg, P<0.01, respectively). Reductions in systolic and DBP loads during follow-up were also evident in the atorvastatin, but not in the placebo group. BP-lowering effects of atorvastatin were consistent in both daytime and nighttime periods. This study shows a mild, but consistent throughout the 24-h period BP-lowering effect of atorvastatin in patients with mild hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. This beneficial effect of atorvastatin on BP may represent another pathway through which this drug class provides cardiovascular risk reduction.

TI  - Lipid-altering efficacy of switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg versus rosuvastatin 10 mg in high-risk patients with and without metabolic syndrome.
AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease risk factors. This post-hoc analysis compared the effects of switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg or rosuvastatin 10 mg in a cohort of 618 high-risk hypercholesterolaemic patients with (n=368) and without (n=217) MetS who had previously been on statin monotherapy. Patients were randomised 1:1 to double-blind ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg or rosuvastatin 10 mg for 6 weeks. Least squares mean percent change from baseline and 95% confidence intervals in lipid efficacy parameters were calculated for the population and within subgroups. Treatment with ezetimibe/simvastatin was significantly more effective than rosuvastatin at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, non- high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (all p<0.001). No significant differences in treatment effects were seen between the presence and absence of MetS. In this post-hoc analysis of high-risk hypercholesterolaemic patients the lipid-reducing effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin or rosuvastatin were not altered significantly by the presence of MetS.

TI  - Acute localized administration of tetrahydrobiopterin and chronic systemic atorvastatin treatment restore cutaneous microvascular function in hypercholesterolaemic humans.
AB  - Elevated oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are associated with vascular dysfunction in the cutaneous microvasculature, induced in part by upregulated arginase activity and increased globalized oxidant stress. Since tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) is an essential cofactor for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), decreased bioavailability of the substrate l-arginine and/or BH(4) may contribute to decreased NO production with hypercholesterolaemia. We hypothesized that (1) localized administration of BH(4) would augment NO-dependent vasodilatation in hypercholesterolaemic human skin, which would be further increased when combined with arginase inhibition and (2) the improvement induced by localized BH(4) would be attenuated after a 3 month oral atorvastatin intervention (10 mg). Four microdialysis fibres were placed in the skin of nine normocholesterolaemic (NC: LDL = 95  4 mg dl(-1)) and nine hypercholesterolaemic (HC: LDL = 177  6 mg dl(-1)) men and women before and after 3 months of systemic atorvastatin. Sites served as control, NOS inhibited, BH(4), and arginase inhibited + BH(4) (combo). Skin blood flow was measured while local skin heating (42C) induced NO-dependent vasodilatation. After the established plateau l-NAME was perfused in all sites to quantify NO-dependent vasodilatation (NO). Data were normalized to maximum cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC). Vasodilatation at the plateau and NO-dependent vasodilatation were reduced in HC subjects (plateau HC: 70  5% CVC(max)vs. NC: 95  2% CVC(max); NO HC: 45  5% CVC(max)vs. NC: 64  5% CVC(max); both P < 0.001). Localized BH(4) alone or combo augmented the plateau (BH(4): 93  3% CVC(max); combo 89  3% CVC(max), both P < 0.001) and NO-dependent vasodilatation in HC (BH(4): 74  3% CVC(max); combo 76  3% CVC(max), both P < 0.001), but there was no effect in NC subjects (plateau BH(4): 90  2% CVC(max); combo 95  3% CVC(max); NO-dependent vasodilatation BH(4): 68  3% CVC(max); combo 58  4% CVC(max), all P > 0.05 vs. control site). After the atorvastatin intervention (LDL = 98  mg * dl(-1)) there was an increase in the plateau in HC (96  4% CVC(max), P < 0.001) and NO-dependent vasodilatation (68  3% CVC(max), P < 0.001). Localized BH(4) alone or combo was less effective at increasing NO-dependent vasodilatation after the drug intervention (BH(4): 60  5% CVC(max); combo 58  2% CVC(max), both P < 0.001). These data suggest that decreased BH(4) bioavailability contributes in part to cutaneous microvascular dysfunction in hypercholesterolaemic humans and that atorvastatin is an effective systemic treatment for improving NOS coupling mechanisms in the microvasculature.

TI  - Study of potential cardioprotective effects of Ganoderma lucidum (Lingzhi): results of a controlled human intervention trial.
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that Lingzhi (Ganoderma lucidum) has antioxidant effects and possibly beneficial effects on blood pressure, plasma lipids and glucose, but these have not been confirmed in subjects with mild hypertension or hyperlipidaemia. The objective of the present study was to assess the cardiovascular, metabolic, antioxidant and immunomodulatory responses to therapy with Lingzhi in patients with borderline elevations of blood pressure and/or cholesterol in a controlled cross-over trial. A total of twenty-six patients received 144 g Lingzhi daily or matching placebo for 12 weeks in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over study with placebo-controlled run-in and cross-over periods. Body weight, blood pressure, metabolic parameters, urine catecholamines and cortisol, antioxidant status and lymphocyte subsets were measured after each period. Lingzhi was well tolerated and data from twenty-three evaluable subjects showed no changes in BMI or blood pressure when treated with Lingzhi or placebo. Plasma insulin and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance were lower after treatment with Lingzhi than after placebo. TAG decreased and HDL-cholesterol increased with Lingzhi but not with placebo in the first treatment period, but significant carry-over effects prevented complete analysis of these parameters. Urine catecholamines and cortisol, plasma antioxidant status and blood lymphocyte subsets showed no significant differences across treatments. Results indicate that Lingzhi might have mild antidiabetic effects and potentially improve the dyslipidaemia of diabetes, as shown previously in some animal studies. Further studies are desirable in patients with hyperglycaemia.

TI  - Oral atorvastatin therapy increases nitric oxide-dependent cutaneous vasodilation in humans by decreasing ascorbate-sensitive oxidants.
AB  - Elevated low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are associated with cutaneous microvascular dysfunction partially mediated by increased arginase activity, which is decreased following a systemic atorvastatin therapy. We hypothesized that increased ascorbate-sensitive oxidant stress, partially mediated through uncoupled nitric oxide synthase (NOS) induced by upregulated arginase, contributes to cutaneous microvascular dysfunction in hypercholesterolemic (HC) humans. Four microdialysis fibers were placed in the skin of nine HC (LDL = 177  6 mg/dl) men and women before and after 3 mo of a systemic atorvastatin intervention and at baseline in nine normocholesterolemic (NC) (LDL = 95  4 mg/dl) subjects. Sites served as control, NOS inhibited, L-ascorbate, and arginase-inhibited+L-ascorbate. Skin blood flow was measured while local skin heating (42C) induced NO-dependent vasodilation. After the established plateau in all sites, 20 mM ngname was infused to quantify NO-dependent vasodilation. Data were normalized to maximum cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) (sodium nitroprusside + 43C). The plateau in vasodilation during local heating (HC: 78  4 vs. NC: 96  2% CVC(max), P < 0.01) and NO-dependent vasodilation (HC: 40  4 vs. NC: 54  4% CVC(max), P < 0.01) was reduced in the HC group. Acute L-ascorbate alone (91  5% CVC(max), P < 0.001) or combined with arginase inhibition (96  3% CVC(max), P < 0.001) augmented the plateau in vasodilation in the HC group but not the NC group (ascorbate: 96  2; combo: 93  4% CVC(max), both P > 0.05). After the atorvastatin intervention NO-dependent vasodilation was augmented in the HC group (HC postatorvastatin: 64  4% CVC(max), P < 0.01), and there was no further effect of ascorbate alone (58  4% CVC(max,) P > 0.05) or combined with arginase inhibition (67  4% CVC(max,) P > 0.05). Increased ascorbate-sensitive oxidants contribute to hypercholesteromic associated cutaneous microvascular dysfunction which is partially reversed with atorvastatin therapy.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of an optimized botanical combination in the management of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.
AB  - This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of an optimized botanical combination containing policosanol, tomato extract, orally bioavailable grape procyanidins and Oenothera biennis oil against placebo in the management of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Such a combination is endowed with biological properties targeted to cholesterol control and vasoprotection. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial consisted of a 6week treatment period following 4week baseline period, and a 2week post-treatment follow-up. At baseline, both the groups were comparable to each other. Both the active treatment and the placebo group included 30 patients (active treatment: mean age 46.807.43years, nine males; placebo: mean age 45.506.76years, eight males). Significant reductions in the LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C; -17.33% from baseline, p<0.001) and total cholesterol (TC; -13.38% from baseline, p<0.0001) values over the treatment period were observed with the tested product. The treatment also resulted in reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) values, which are indices of oxidative stress. This rational combination of different compounds is effective and safe in lowering the elevated LDL-C and TC values. It is also effective in the modulation of the oxidation indices values; however, a further long term study in a larger population would be needed in order to confirm these preliminary findings.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of pitavastatin in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia: LIVES study and subanalysis.
AB  - The Livalo Effectiveness and Safety (LIVES) study was an observational study to examine the efficacy and safety of pitavastatin, a newly developed drug, in approximately 20,000 Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia. During a 2-year follow-up period, no significant problems concerning safety were observed upon treatment with pitavastatin. Pitavastatin demonstrated potent and stable lowering of the LDL-cholesterol level. The LIVES study subanalyses revealed significant and continuous elevation of HDL-cholesterol in association with pitavastatin treatment and also showed that the drug did not adversely affect glycemic control as evaluated by the glycohemoglobin A(1c) level. Moreover, pitavastatin treatment was associated with an increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate in subjects with chronic kidney disease. These results suggest the usefulness of pitavastatin in hypercholesterolemic patients from various backgrounds. The ongoing LIVES study extension is expected to provide further data on cardiovascular outcome in subjects treated with pitavastatin.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe added on to rosuvastatin 5 or 10 mg versus up-titration of rosuvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia (the ACTE Study).
AB  - The present multicenter, 6-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe (10 mg) added to stable rosuvastatin therapy versus up-titration of rosuvastatin from 5 to 10 mg or from 10 to 20 mg. The study population included 440 subjects at moderately high/high risk of coronary heart disease with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels higher than the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations (<100 mg/dl for moderately high/high-risk subjects without atherosclerotic vascular disease or <70 mg/dl for high-risk subjects with atherosclerotic vascular disease). Pooled data demonstrated that ezetimibe added to stable rosuvastatin 5 mg or 10 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by 21%. In contrast, doubling rosuvastatin to 10 mg or 20 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by 5.7% (between-group difference of 15.2%, p <0.001). Individually, ezetimibe plus rosuvastatin 5 mg reduced LDL cholesterol more than did rosuvastatin 10 mg (12.3% difference, p <0.001), and ezetimibe plus rosuvastatin 10 mg reduced LDL cholesterol more than did rosuvastatin 20 mg (17.5% difference, p <0.001). Compared to rosuvastatin up-titration, ezetimibe add-on achieved significantly greater attainment of LDL cholesterol levels of <70 or <100 mg/dl (59.4% vs 30.9%, p <0.001), and <70 mg/dl in all subjects (43.8% vs 17.5%, p <0.001); produced significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (p <0.001); and resulted in similar effects on other lipid parameters. Adverse experiences were generally comparable among the groups. In conclusion, compared to up-titration doubling of the rosuvastatin dose, ezetimibe 10 mg added to stable rosuvastatin 5 mg or 10 mg produced greater improvements in many lipid parameters and achieved greater attainment of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommended LDL cholesterol targets in subjects with elevated LDL cholesterol and at moderately high/high coronary heart disease risk.

TI  - Multi-center study on the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - Hypercholesterolemia is one of the most representative disorders of the common diseases. To evaluate the prevalence of hypothyroidism in the population of adult hypercholesterolemia, we prospectively examined the thyroid function in patients with untreated or treated hypercholesterolemia as a multi-center survey. Subjects were the patients who were treated with some antilipemic agents or the untreated patients whose total cholesterol (TC) was over 220 mg/dL and/or LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) over 140 mg/dL. Among 737 cases recruited, 725 cases (300 males and 425 females) participated in the survey including the thyroid function test. The patient's backgrounds include hypertension (51%), diabetes mellitus (49%), fatty liver (17%), smoking (15%), and habitual drinking (10%). The 72% of the patients were treated with some antilipemic agents and the mean values of TC, LDL-C, triglyceride (TG), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (L/H) were 204.5 mg/dL, 119.6 mg/dL, 144.4 mg/dL, 60.7 mg/dL and 2.25, respectively. The primary hypothyroidism was seen in 27 cases (3.7%) (11 males, 16 females) with subclinical hypothyroidism in 17 cases (2.4%) and overt hypothyroidism in 10 cases (1.4%). The central hypothyroidism was seen in 4 cases (0.6%). The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 4.3% in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Taking account of the large number of patients with dyslipidemia and importance of avoiding unnecessary administration and associated adverse effects, evaluation of the thyroid function could be warranted in patients with dyslipidemia although cost-benefit issues waits further investigation.

TI  - Oral atorvastatin therapy restores cutaneous microvascular function by decreasing arginase activity in hypercholesterolaemic humans.
AB  - Elevated low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are associated with vascular dysfunction evident in the cutaneous microvasculature. We hypothesized that uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) through upregulated arginase contributes to cutaneous microvascular dysfunction in hyperocholesterolaemic (HC) humans and that a statin intervention would decrease arginase activity. Five microdialysis fibres were placed in the skin of nine normocholesterolaemic (NC: LDL level 954 mg dl) and nine hypercholesterolaemic (HC: LDL: 1776 mg dl) men and women before and after 3 months of systemic atrovastatin. Sites served as control, NOS inhibited, arginase inhibited, L-arginine supplemented and arginase inhibited plus L-arginine supplemented. Skin blood flow was measured while local skin heating (42C) induced NO-dependent vasodilatation. L-NAME was infused after the established plateau in all sites to quantify NO-dependent vasodilatation. Data were normalized to maximum cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC(max)). Skin samples were obtained to measure total arginase activity and arginase I and arginase II protein. Vasodilatation was reduced in hyperocholesterolaemic subjects (HC: 762 vs. NC: 943%CVC(max), P < 0.001) as was NO-dependent vasodilatation (HC: 435 vs. NC: 624%CVC(max), P < 0.001). The plateau and NO-dependent vasodilatation were augmented in HC with arginase inhibition (922, 672%CVC(max), P < 0.001), L-arginine (932, 715%CVC(max), P < 0.001) and combined treatments (944, 655%CVC(max), P < 0.001) but not in NC. After statin intervention (LDL: 985 mg dl) there was no longer a difference between control sites (884, 615%CVC(max)) and localized microdialysis treatment sites (all P > 0.05). Arginase activity and protein were increased in HC skin (P < 0.05 vs. NC) and activity decreased with atrovastatin treatment (P < 0.05). Reduced NOS3 substrate availability through upregulated arginase contributes to cutaneous microvascular dysfunction in hyperocholesterolaemic humans, which is corrected with atorvastatin therapy.

TI  - The effect of ezetimibe and simvastatin on hemostasis in patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the strength of hemostatic effects of ezetimibe, administered alone or in combination with simvastatin, in patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia. One hundred and four patients with isolated primary hypercholesterolemia were randomized to one of four treatment groups, simultaneously treated for 90 days with ezetimibe (10 mg daily), simvastatin (40 mg daily), ezetimibe (10 mg daily) plus simvastatin (40 mg daily), or placebo. Plasma lipids/lipoproteins and hemostatic cardiovascular risk factors were assessed on the day of randomization and after 30 and 90 days of therapy. Despite improving lipid/lipoprotein profile by both simvastatin and ezetimibe, only simvastatin reduced plasma levels/activity of fibrinogen, factor VII, factor X, von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The strongest effects on plasma lipids/lipoproteins and the assessed hemostatic variables were observed when patients were treated with both simvastatin and ezetimibe. With the exception of oxidized low-density lipoproteins, the hemostatic effects of simvastatin or simvastatin plus ezetimibe did not correlate with the changes in plasma lipids/lipoproteins. Our study shows that simvastatin is a more effective agent than ezetimibe in affecting coagulation and fibrinolysis in individuals with isolated hypercholesterolemia. It also suggests that the combined administration of simvastatin and ezetimibe may bring more benefits to patients than monotherapy with only one of these agents.

TI  - Efficacy of ezetimibe as monotherapy or combination therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients with and without diabetes.
AB  - Ezetimibe selectively inhibits dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption and reduces serum cholesterol levels when administered alone (monotherapy) and along with common lipid-regulating agents (combination therapy). To evaluate the effect of ezetimibe therapy on the lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and levels of cholesterol absorption and synthesis markers, we administered 10 mg ezetimibe to 50 hypercholesterolemic patients with or without diabetes. The serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol were significantly reduced at 4 and 12 weeks of ezetimibe therapy in diabetic patients of both the monotherapy and combination-therapy groups and in nondiabetic patients of the combination-therapy group. The serum levels of the cholesterol absorption markers were significantly reduced, while those of the cholesterol synthesis markers were significantly increased at 12 weeks of ezetimibe therapy. No significant differences were noted in the values of the parameters of glucose metabolism in all patients. We also investigated the clinical characteristics of patients who exhibited a good response to ezetimibe (ezetimibe responders); however, multivariate regression analysis did not reveal a correlation between ezetimibe efficacy and patient characteristics such as gender, age, BMI, diabetic condition, method of ezetimibe administration, and the initial absolute values of cholesterol absorption/synthesis markers levels. In conclusion, ezetimibe therapy significantly improved the lipid profile without disturbing glucose metabolism. We were unable to identify the specific characteristics of ezetimibe responders among our subjects. However, we may interpret this result as suggesting that ezetimibe can be used in any population to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

TI  - The effect of a platelet cholesterol modulation on the acetylsalicylic acid-mediated blood platelet inhibition in hypercholesterolemic patients.
AB  - Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) is widely used in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, but its beneficial effects may be restrained in some individuals, where the reduced ability of ASA to protect against arterial thrombotic events is observed. We analyzed the influence of the treatment with atorvastatin (10mg/day) on the platelet sensitivity to ASA monitored under in vitro conditions in hypercholesterolemic patients. The associations between plasma or platelet cholesterol parameters and the ASA-mediated inhibition of platelet reactivity or the extent of platelet protein acetylation by ASA were estimated in the patients treated with atorvastatin for 1, 3, or 6 months. Out of 27 patients, in 17 individuals platelets appeared significantly more sensitive to 50 M ASA in arachidonic acid- or collagen-induced whole blood aggregation following 1 month atorvastatin therapy (inhibition by 60.9  5.6% vs. 48.8  5.4%, P<0.05 for 0.5mM arachidonic acid, 40.8  2.9% vs. 27.0  4.1%, P<0.05 for 1 g/ml collagen), and this effect lasted for 3 and 6 months, remaining in a weak, although significant, relation to the reduction of platelet cholesterol content (R(S)=-0.277, P<0.002 for arachidonic acid, R(S)=-0.197, P<0.02 for collagen). It was, however, not dependent upon either antiplatelet action or plasma lipid-lowering activity of atorvastatin. In addition, in about 50% of patients, we noticed that ASA (50 M) significantly and time-dependently diminished thromboxane B(2) concentration in atorvastatin-treated patients. The ASA-induced acetylation of platelet proteins significantly increased in the course of atorvastatin therapy and was associated with reduced platelet cholesterol (R(S)=-0.598, P<0.0001). In conclusion, statin therapy may improve platelet sensitivity to ASA in some hypercholesterolemic patients. This effect may extend beyond the action of atorvastatin as merely a lipid-lowering agent. The mechanisms of resistance of some patients to such a combined ASA-statin treatment remain to be elucidated.

TI  - Ezetimibe treatment lowers indicators of oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic subjects with high oxidative stress.
AB  - Ezetimibe effectively reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ezetimibe monotherapy may also decrease markers of oxidative stress in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Subjects with hypercholesterolemia and no evidence of cardiovascular disease were randomly allocated to open-label ezetimibe monotherapy 10 mg/day (EZT group) or therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC group). At baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment serum lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels as well as oxidative stress parameters, including oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), 8-isoprostanes (8-epiPGF2a) and reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) levels, were blindly determined. A total of 60 patients were included; 30 in each group. Despite a significant decrease in ox-LDL levels (by 20.8%, p < 0.001 vs. baseline; p < 0.001 vs. TLC group) in the EZT group no change in the ratio ox-LDL to LDL-C was noticed following ezetimibe treatment. No significant change in 8-epiPGF2a and d-ROMs levels was observed in the EZT group. Of note, a significant decrease in 8-epiPGF2a and d-ROMs levels (by 20.4% and 18.2%, respectively, p < 0.01 vs. baseline for both), was noted among patients in the EZT group who exhibited 'high oxidative stress' at baseline. No change in any of oxidative stress parameters was noted in the TLC group. Ezetimibe may decrease markers of oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic subjects. This benefit may be more profound among patients who exhibit 'high oxidative stress' at baseline.

TI  - Pleiotropic effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin vs. high dose simvastatin.
AB  - These data suggest that among stable CAD patients treated with S20, (1) both E10/S20 and S80 were equally effective in further reducing LDL-C; (2) neither treatment had any further significant anti-inflammatory effects; and (3) E10/S20 was more effective than S80 in inhibiting platelet aggregation. Thus, despite similar lipid lowering and doses 4 less of simvastatin, E10/S20 induced a greater platelet inhibitory effect than S80.

TI  - High-dose atorvastatin enhances impaired cerebral vasomotor reactivity.
AB  - The influence of statin therapy on cerebral vasomotor function has not been fully characterized. We report the effects of high-dose atorvastatin therapy on cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) in patients with controlled hypertension and dyslipidemia. We prospectively enrolled 36 patients with controlled hypertension and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration >100 mg/dL. Atorvastatin 80 mg was given daily for 6 months and then discontinued. VMR was assessed by hypercapnic and hypocapnic transcranial Doppler challenge in both the right and left middle cerebral artery (MCA) at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Forty-five days after statin cessation, a repeat VMR was performed. VMR impairment was defined as 70%. Blood pressure, lipid levels, liver function, and creatine kinase level were monitored. Mean patient age was 60 years, 16 were men, and 13 had a previous history of subcortical infarction. Mean LDL cholesterol level before treatment was 154  30 mg/dL. Atorvastatin lowered LDL by 53% at 3 months and by 46% at 6 months. Baseline VMR was 71%  21% in the right MCA and 70%  19% in the left MCA. No significant effect of atorvastatin on VMR was seen at 3 months and 6 months in the study population as a whole. In the subgroup of patients with baseline VMR impairment, atorvastatin therapy was associated with significantly improved VMR at both 3 and 6 months. This effect persisted for at least 45 days after discontinuation of therapy. Our findings indicate that high-dose atorvastatin therapy can significantly improve impaired cerebral VMR, and that the effects of atorvastatin on VMR persist for 1.5 months after discontinuation of therapy. We found no benefit of atorvastatin therapy in patients with preserved baseline vasoreactivity.

TI  - Effects of prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters on fasting lipid profile in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - This double-blind, randomized crossover study investigated the effects of 6 weeks of treatment with prescription omega-3-acid ethyl esters (POM3, 4 g/day) versus placebo (soy oil) on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other aspects of the fasting lipid profile in 31 men and women with primary, isolated hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C 130-220 mg/dL and triglycerides less than 150 mg/dL while free of lipid-altering therapies). Mean  standard error of the mean baseline concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were 229  3, 146  3, 60  2, 23  2, and 113  8 mg/dL, respectively. POM3 produced a modest increase from baseline in LDL-C (3.4%) versus the placebo response (-0.7%, P = 0.010). Significant changes (P < 0.05) for POM3 (placebo-corrected) were observed for very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-18.8%), triglycerides (-18.7%), and HDL-C (3.3%). Nuclear magnetic resonance-determined very-low-density lipoprotein particle concentration and size and HDL particle concentration decreased significantly more with POM3 versus placebo, whereas LDL and HDL particle sizes increased significantly more with POM3 versus placebo. Total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, apolipoproteins A1 and B, and LDL particle concentration responses did not differ between treatments. These results did not confirm the hypothesis that POM3 treatment would lower LDL-C in primary, isolated hypercholesterolemia. Effects on other variables were consistent with prior results in mixed dyslipidemia.

TI  - The effect of ezetimibe and simvastatin on monocyte cytokine release in patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - Apart from reducing plasma lipids, ezetimibe may produce non-lipid-related pleiotropic effects. The aim of this article was to compare the effect of ezetimibe and simvastatin on monocyte cytokine release and systemic inflammation in isolated hypercholesterolemic patients. One hundred thirty-four subjects with isolated hypercholesterolemia were allocated to 1 of 4 treatment groups treated for 90 days with, respectively, ezetimibe, simvastatin, ezetimibe plus simvastatin, or placebo. Monocyte cytokine release was determined at baseline and after 30 and 90 days of treatment. Compared with placebo, all the remaining treatment options reduced-monocyte release of tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which was accompanied by a reduction in plasma C-reactive protein levels. In subjects receiving both simvastatin and ezetimibe, posttreatment monocyte cytokine release and plasma C-reactive protein levels did not differ from those observed in 30 matched healthy subjects. Monocyte-suppressing and systemic-anti-inflammatory effects were more expressed in simvastatin- than in ezetimibe-treated patients and strongest when both the agents were administered together. The results obtained suggest that simvastatin may be a better treatment option than ezetimibe in isolated hypercholesterolemic patients and that hypercholesterolemic patients of high cardiovascular risk may benefit the most from combined treatment with simvastatin and ezetimibe.

TI  - The whey fermentation product malleable protein matrix decreases triglyceride concentrations in subjects with hypercholesterolemia: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - Malleable protein matrix (MPM) is a unique whey-derived ingredient obtained through a fermentation process using proprietary lactic acid bacteria strains from the Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens species. Because evidence from animal models suggests that MPM decreases serum lipid concentrations, the purpose of the present trial was to assess the hypothesis that MPM exerts lipid-lowering effects in humans. A total of 161 subjects (50% male; age 54.5  9.8 yr, body mass index 26.3  3.6 kg/m(2)) with hypercholesterolemia with baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of 181  30 mg/dL and normal triglyceride (TG) levels (131  55 mg/dL) were randomized to receive MPM (2  15 g/d) or matching placebo. A 6-wk run-in phase was followed by a double-blind 12-wk treatment phase after randomization. The data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome measure was the percentage change of LDL-C. The secondary outcome measures were changes in TG and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations as well as changes in other cardiovascular risk factors. After 12 wk of treatment, the relative TG decrease from baseline reached 9.8%, whereas LDL-C was slightly decreased (by 1.5%) following MPM treatment compared with placebo in the intention-to-treat cohort. The treatment effect on TG reduction was much higher in the subset of subjects having TG levels at baseline of 150 mg/dL or above (n=42), reaching 20.0% compared with placebo. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose remained unchanged, whereas a positive treatment effect was seen on hemoglobin A(1c). The MPM product was tolerated well without severe adverse events. In conclusion, MPM has significant TG-lowering properties in subjects with combined hypercholesterolemia and higher TG levels. Its effects on LDL-C concentrations and glucose metabolism deserve further investigation.

TI  - Effects of vitamin E on plasma lipid status and oxidative stress in Chinese women with metabolic syndrome.
AB  - Following the change of dietary structure and living style, metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become increasingly common in China, especially in women, who have abnormal plasma lipid profiles with increased levels of oxidative stress. Vitamin E (VitE) is a powerful chain-breaking antioxidant, which may be a protective factor against oxidative stress-related diseases. This study investigated the effects of three different dosages of tocopherol supplementation (100 IU /day, 200 IU /day, 300 IU /day) for 4 months in Chinese women with MetS. The plasma VitE concentrations increased significantly after the 4 months of supplementation (p < 0.01). The protective decreases in plasma total cholesterol were significant in 200 IU/day and 300 IU/day VitE groups (p < 0.05), but decreases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also significant in all the supplementation groups (p < 0.05). Plasma triglycerides were unaltered (p > 0.05). The indicators of oxidative stress decreased substantially in all of the VitE supplementation groups: malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced by nearly 50 percent (all groups, p < 0.001), erythrocyte hemolysis was decreased by nearly 40 percent (all groups, p < 0.05); among which the 300IU/day VitE group showed the most significant effect. However, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased after the trial (p < 0.001). VitE provided marked benefits in reducing oxidative stress levels and improving lipid status in women with MetS. Although no dose-effect relationship was observed, 300 IU VitE per day showed the optimal effect. Research is needed to identify potential protective mechanisms or utilization of vitamin E during MetS.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of ezetimibe/simvastatin combination versus atorvastatin alone in adults 65 years of age with hypercholesterolemia and with or at moderately high/high risk for coronary heart disease (the VYTELD study).
AB  - Higher than 80% of coronary heart disease-related mortality occurs in patients 65 years of age. Guidelines recommend low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol targets for these at-risk patients; however, few clinical studies have evaluated lipid-lowering strategies specifically in older adults. This multicenter, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of the usual starting dose of ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/20 mg) versus atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg and the next higher dose of ezetimibe/simvastatin (10/40 mg) versus atorvastatin 40 mg in 1,289 hypercholesterolemic patients 65 years of age with or without cardiovascular disease. Patients randomized to ezetimibe/simvastatin had greater percent decreases in LDL cholesterol (-54.2% for 10/20 mg vs -39.5% and -46.6% for atorvastatin 10 and 20 mg, respectively; -59.1% for 10/40 mg vs -50.8% for atorvastatin 40 mg; p <0.001 for all comparisons) and the number attaining LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl (51.3% for 10/20 mg, 68.2% for 10/40 mg) and <100 mg/dl (83.6% for 10/20 mg; 90.3% for 10/40 mg) was significantly larger compared to those receiving atorvastatin for all prespecified dose comparisons (p <0.05 to <0.001). A significantly larger percentage of high-risk patients achieved LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl on ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (54.3%) versus atorvastatin 10 mg (10.9%, p <0.001) or 20 mg (28.9%, p <0.001) and ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg (69.2%) versus atorvastatin 40 mg (38.2%, p <0.001), and a significantly larger percentage of intermediate-risk patients achieved LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl on ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (82.1%) versus atorvastatin 10 mg (59.3%, p <0.05). Improvements in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein ratios were significantly greater with ezetimibe/simvastatin than atorvastatin for all comparisons (p <0.01 to <0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride results were variable. All treatments were generally well tolerated. In conclusion, ezetimibe/simvastatin provided significantly greater improvements in key lipid parameters and higher attainment of LDL cholesterol targets than atorvastatin, with comparable tolerability.

TI  - Pitavastatin further decreases serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein levels in hypertensive patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with angiotensin II, type-1 receptor antagonists.
AB  - Lipid-lowering therapy with a statin not only powerfully lowers cholesterol but also exerts anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing serum C-reactive protein (CRP). Since an angiotensin II, type-1 receptor antagonist (ARB) also decreases CRP levels, the add-on effect of statins on CRP may be worth exploring. We determined the effect of pitavastatin on serum levels of highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) in 30 patients with hypercholesterolemia undergoing treatment with anti-hypertensive medication including ARBs. Pitavastatin, 2 mg daily, was given. The control group consisted of hypertensive patients without hyperlipidemia. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and hs-CRP were measured at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. For the atherosclerotic index, LDL-C/HDL-C ratios at 12 months were calculated. The LDL-C level was markedly reduced at 1 month and thereafter. The baseline level of hs-CRP in the hyperlipidemia group was significantly higher than that in the control group (1.647  0.210 mg/L vs. 0.666  0.097 mg/L p < 0.0001). After 3 months, the percentage of reduction of hs-CRP was significantly higher than that in the control group. The absolute values of hs-CRP were significantly decreased to a level similar to the control group, and the hs-CRP in both groups was remained at the same level for 12 months. Although the LDL-C/HDL-C ratios of the pitavastatin group was significantly reduced from 3.3 to 1.8, those of the control group were not changed. In conclusion, pitavastatin was found to have powerful anti-inflammatory, add-on effects over the similar effects of ARB as assessed by hs-CRP.

TI  - Lactobacillus gasseri [corrected] CHO-220 and inulin reduced plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol via alteration of lipid transporters.
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-designed study was conducted to investigate the effect of a synbiotic product containing Lactobacillus gasseri [corrected] CHO-220 and inulin on lipid profiles of hypercholesterolemic men and women. Thirty-two hypercholesterolemic men and women with initial mean plasma cholesterol levels of 5.70.32 mmol/L were recruited for the 12-wk study. The subjects were randomly allocated to 2 groups; namely the treatment group (synbiotic product) and the control group (placebo), and each received 4 capsules of synbiotic or placebo daily. Our results showed that the mean body weight, energy, and nutrient intake of the subjects did not differ between the 2 groups over the study period. The supplementation of synbiotic reduced plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by 7.84 and 9.27%, respectively, compared with the control over 12 wk. Lipoproteins were subsequently subfractionated and characterized. The synbiotic supplementation resulted in a lower concentration of triglycerides in the very low, intermediate, low, and high-density lipoprotein particles compared with the control over 12 wk. The concentration of triglycerides in lipoproteins is positively correlated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Our results showed that the synbiotic might exhibit an atheropreventive characteristic. Cholesteryl ester (CE) in the high-density lipoprotein particles of the synbiotic group was also higher compared with the control, indicating greater transport of cholesterol in the form of CE to the liver for hydrolysis. This may have led to the reduced plasma total cholesterol level of the synbiotic group. The supplementation of synbiotic also reduced the concentration of CE in the LDL particles compared with the control, leading to the formation of smaller and denser particles that are more easily removed from blood. This supported the reduced LDL-cholesterol level of the synbiotic group compared with the control. Our present study showed that the synbiotic product improved plasma total- and LDL-cholesterol levels by modifying the interconnected pathways of lipid transporters. In addition, although Lactobacillus gasseri [corrected] CHO-220 could deconjugate bile, our results showed a statistically insignificant difference in the levels of conjugated, deconjugated, primary, and secondary bile acids between the synbiotic and control groups over 12 wk, indicating safety from bile-related toxicity.

AB  - This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-design study was conducted to investigate the effect of a synbiotic product containing Lactobacillus gasseri [corrected] CHO-220 and inulin on the irregularity in shape of red blood cells (RBC) in hypercholesterolemic subjects. The subjects (n=32) were randomly allocated to 2 groups, a treatment group (synbiotic product) and a control group (placebo), and received 4 capsules of either synbiotic or placebo daily for 12 wk. Morphological representation via scanning electron microscopy showed that the occurrence of spur RBC was improved upon supplementation of the synbiotic. In addition, the supplementation of synbiotic reduced the cholesterol:phospholipids ratio of the RBC membrane by 47.02% over 12 wk, whereas the control showed insignificant changes. Our present study also showed that supplementation of the synbiotic reduced the concentration of saturated fatty acids (SFA), increased unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), and increased the ratio of UFA:SFA over 12 wk, whereas the control showed inconspicuous changes. The alteration of RBC membrane was assessed using fluorescence anisotropy (FAn) and fluorescence probes with different affinities for varying sections of the membrane phospholipid bilayer. A noticeable decrease in FAn of three fluorescent probes was observed in the synbiotic group compared with the control over 12 wk, indicative of increased membrane fluidity and reduced cholesterol enrichment in the RBC membrane.

Ezetimibe combined with atorvastatin generally produced greater incremental reductions in LDL cholesterol and several other key lipid parameters compared with doubling the atorvastatin dose in hypercholesterolemic patients with high or moderately high CHD risk. These results suggest that co-administration of ezetimibe with statins is a useful therapeutic option for treatment of dyslipidemia in differing patient populations.

TI  - Atorvastatin inhibits oxidative stress via adiponectin-mediated NADPH oxidase down-regulation in hypercholesterolemic patients.
AB  - This study provides the first evidence that in patients higher APN serum levels are associated with gp91(phox) down-regulation. APN-mediated gp91(phox) reduction could be one of the mechanisms involved in atorvastatin's antioxidant effect.

TI  - Whole and fractionated yellow pea flours reduce fasting insulin and insulin resistance in hypercholesterolaemic and overweight human subjects.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to compare whole pea flour (WPF) to fractionated pea flour (FPF; hulls only) for their ability to reduce risk factors associated with CVD and diabetes in overweight hypercholesterolaemic individuals. Using a cross-over design, twenty-three hypercholesterolaemic overweight men and women received two-treatment muffins/d containing WPF, FPF or white wheat flour (WF) for 28 d, followed by 28 d washout periods. Daily doses of WPF and FPF complied with the United States Department of Agriculture's recommended level of intake of half a cup of pulses/d (approximately 50 g/d). Dietary energy requirements were calculated for each study subject, and volunteers were only permitted to eat food supplied by the study personnel. Fasting insulin, body composition, urinary enterolactone levels, postprandial glucose response, as well as fasting lipid and glucose concentrations, were assessed at the beginning and at the end of each treatment. Insulin concentrations for WPF (378 (SEM 34) pmol/ml, P = 0021) and FPF (405 (SEM 34) pmol/ml, P = 0037) were lower compared with WF (507 (SEM 34) pmol/ml). Insulin homeostasis modelling assessment showed that consumption of WPF and FPF decreased (P < 005) estimates of insulin resistance (IR) compared with WF. Android:gynoid fat ratios in women participants were lower (P = 0027) in the WPF (101 (sem 001) group compared with the WF group (106 (SEM 001). Urinary enterolactone levels tended to be higher (P = 0087) in WPF compared with WF. Neither treatment altered circulating fasting lipids or glucose concentrations. In conclusion, under a controlled diet paradigm, a daily consumption of whole and fractionated yellow pea flours at doses equivalent to half a cup of yellow peas/d reduced IR, while WPF reduced android adiposity in women.

TI  - Flaxseed lignan lowers blood cholesterol and decreases liver disease risk factors in moderately hypercholesterolemic men.
AB  - The effects of flaxseed lignan (secoisolariciresinol diglucoside [SDG]) intake on hypercholesterolemia and liver disease risk factors in moderately hypercholesterolemic men were investigated. In a previous study, we reported that SDG attenuates high-fat, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in mice. Here, we report a double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled study in moderately hypercholesterolemic men in which we investigated the hypothesis that oral administration of SDG (20 or 100 mg) would decrease the level of blood cholesterol and liver disease risk factors induced by hypercholesterolemia in humans. Thirty men with total cholesterol levels of 4.65 to 6.21 mmol/L (180-240 mg/dL) were randomly assigned to 3 groups; 2 groups received flaxseed lignan capsules (SDG, 20 or 100 mg/d) and the other received placebo capsules for 12 weeks. We found that, compared to the subjects who received placebo, those who received 100 mg of SDG exhibited a significant reduction in the ratio of low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at baseline (P < .05) and at week 12 (P < .05). In addition, in SDG-treated subjects, we also observed a significant percentage decrease in the levels of glutamic pyruvic transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase relative to the levels at baseline (P < .01) and a significant percentage decrease in the level of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase relative to the placebo-treated group (P < .05). These results suggest that daily administration of 100 mg SDG can be effective at reducing blood level of cholesterol and hepatic diseases risk in moderately hypercholesterolemic men.

TI  - Lipid-lowering effects of ezetimibe for hypercholesterolemic patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  - To date, there are very few clinical reports that have compared the effects of ezetimibe on lipid parameters between hypercholesterolemic patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, we recruited patients for hypercholesterolemic groups with T2DM (n = 42; men/women = 24/18; HbA1c = 6.7  5.4%) and without T2DM (n = 21; men/women = 7/14; HbA1c = 5.3  0.4%). Patients were prescribed ezetimibe at a dose of 10 mg/daily for the course of the 12-week study. At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment, several lipid parameters, including serum low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and cholesterol synthesis/absorption-related markers, were measured. Compared with those at the baseline, the levels of LDL-C, non-HDL-C, campesterol, and sitosterol were significantly reduced after 12 weeks of ezetimibe treatment in both groups. After adjusting for confounding factors, such as age, gender, smoking, and BMI, the levels of LDL-C and non-HDL-C displayed significantly greater reductions in the patients with T2DM (-25.1  13.6% in LDL-C, -20.5  11.2% in non-HDL-C) than those without T2DM (-20.5  7.8% in LDL-C, P < 0.05; -17.4  7.6% in non-HDL-C, P < 0.05). The reduction of the level of cholestanol was significantly and positively correlated with those of LDL-C and non-HDL-C in the patients with T2DM. Taken together, these findings indicate that ezetimibe could reduce the levels of atherogenic lipoproteins to a greater extent in hypercholesterolemic patients with T2DM than in those without T2DM.

TI  - Short-term treatment with high-dose atorvastatin reduces LDL cholesterol but shows no anti-inflammatory effects in normolipidemic subjects with normal CRP levels.
AB  - The benefit in reducing cardiovascular risk with statins has been attributed both to cholesterol lowering and pleiotropic effects. These pleiotropic effects are thought to include attenuation of the inflammatory response due to reduced prenylation of proteins in the inflammatory cascade. We conducted studies in normolipidemic subjects to determine if treatment with high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin could reduce circulating levels of inflammatory markers. We also determined whether high-dose atorvastatin affected the inflammatory response of monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ex vivo. We found that treatment with atorvastatin rapidly and significantly reduced plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in subjects treated for 2 weeks. However, statin treatment had no discernible effect on plasma levels of the inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, or interleukin (IL-6) and no effect on the cytokine response of monocytes following ex vivo stimulation with LPS. High-dose atorvastatin treatment of normolipidemic subjects with normal C-reactive protein levels has no effect on the inflammatory response assessed by monocyte stimulation with LPS ex vivo despite significant reductions in LDL cholesterol levels.

TI  - Fasting reduces plasma proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin type 9 and cholesterol biosynthesis in humans.
AB  - Proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key regulator of plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) and cardiovascular risk, is produced in liver and secreted into plasma where it binds hepatic LDL receptors (LDLR), leading to their degradation. PCSK9 is transcriptionally activated by sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP)-2, a transcription factor that also activates all genes for cholesterol synthesis as well as the LDLR. Here we investigated the relationship between plasma PCSK9 levels and the lathosterol-to-cholesterol ratio, a marker of cholesterol biosynthesis, in 18 healthy subjects during a 48 h fast. In all individuals, plasma PCSK9 levels declined steadily during the fasting period, reaching a nadir at 36 h that was 58% lower than levels measured in the fed state (P < 0.001). Similarly, the lathosterol-to-cholesterol ratio declined in parallel with plasma PCSK9 concentrations during the fast, reaching a nadir at 36 h that was 28% lower than that measured in the fed state (P = 0.024). In summary, fasting has a marked effect on plasma PCSK9 concentrations, which is mirrored by measures of cholesterol synthesis in humans. Inasmuch as cholesterol synthesis and PCSK9 are both regulated by SREBP-2, these results suggest that plasma PCSK9 levels may serve as a surrogate marker of hepatic SREBP-2 activity in humans.

TI  - Lifibrol as a model compound for a novel lipid-lowering mechanism of action.
AB  - Lifibrol is a potent lipid-lowering drug with an unknown mechanism of action. We investigated its effects on lipoprotein and sterol metabolism in normocholesterolemic male participants. Seven participants were treated for 4 weeks with 600 mg/d lifibrol and 9 with 40 mg/d pravastatin in a double-blind randomized parallel-group trial. Kinetic studies were performed at baseline and under acute and chronic treatment. Turnover of apolipoprotein B-100 was investigated with endogenous stable-isotope labeling, and kinetic parameters were derived by multicompartmental modeling. Lathosterol and cholesterol metabolism were investigated using mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) after [1-(13)C]acetate labeling. Carbon metabolism was investigated by calculating the total isotope incorporation into newly formed sterols and measuring the disposal of acetate by (13)CO(2) breath analysis. Total- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased by 18% and 27% under lifibrol and by 17% and 28% under pravastatin, respectively, whereas very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol did not change. Very-low-density lipoprotein apoB fractional synthesis and production increased under lifibrol but remained unchanged under pravastatin. Low-density lipoprotein apoB fractional synthesis and production increased under pravastatin but remained unchanged under lifibrol. Mass isotopomer distribution analysis indicated that both drugs decrease endogenous sterol synthesis after acute administration, but pravastatin had more powerful effects. Carbon-13 appearance in breath was higher during pravastatin than during lifibrol treatment. Mass isotopomer distribution analysis and carbon metabolism analysis indicated compartmentalization at the site of sterol synthesis, thus suggesting differential effects of the 2 drugs. Although having comparable lipid-lowering properties, lifibrol seems to have a mechanism of action distinct from that of statins. Lifibrol could serve as a model compound for the development of new lipid-lowering agents.

TI  - Effects of simvastatin on carotenoid status in plasma.
AB  - To summarize, the change in carotenoid status during simvastatin therapy was mainly attributed to the lowering of cholesterol and not to the suppression of inflammatory activity. After adjustment for lipids, the levels of lutein, lycopene, -carotene and -carotene were significantly increased by simvastatin suggesting an increased ratio of carotenoids per particle.

TI  - Simvastatin reduces sympathetic activity in men with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - Beyond their hypolipidemic effect, statins reduce cardiovascular risk in hypertensive subjects via various mechanisms; one suggested mechanism is that they reduce sympathetic activity. We investigated the hypothesis that simvastatin decreased muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in 31 hypertensive subjects with hypercholesterolemia (aged 38.7  10 years). In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, patients were treated with simvastatin (40mgday(-1); n=15) or placebo (n=16) for 8 weeks. Before and after treatment, we measured MSNA, blood pressure and heart rate. Baroreceptor control of the heart rate, or baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), was computed by the sequence method, a cross-analysis of systolic blood pressure and the electrocardiogram R-R interval. Blood samples were tested for plasma levels of catecholamines, neuropeptide Y, aldosterone, endothelin and renin activity. Simvastatin significantly reduced MSNA (from 36.5  5 to 27.8  6 bursts per min, P=0.001), heart rate (from 77  6.7 to 71  6.1 beats per min, P=0.01) and both total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 249  30.6 to 184  28.3mgdl(-1), P=0.001 and from 169  30.6 to 117  31.2mgdl(-1), P=0.01, respectively). Simvastatin also improved BRS (from 10.3  4.1 to 17.1  4.3ms per mmHg, P=0.04). No changes were observed in systolic or diastolic blood pressures, or in plasma levels of catecholamines, neuropeptide Y, endothelin, aldosterone and renin activity. After simvastatin therapy, MSNA and BRS were inversely related (r=-0.94, P<0.05). In conclusion, we found that, in patients with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, simvastatin reduced MSNA, and this was related to increased baroreceptor sensitivity.

TI  - The citrus flavonoids hesperidin and naringin do not affect serum cholesterol in moderately hypercholesterolemic men and women.
AB  - The citrus flavonoids hesperidin and naringin have been suggested to lower blood total (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) both in animal models and humans. However, the evidence from previous studies in humans is not convincing. This study evaluated the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of pure hesperidin and naringin in moderately hypercholesterolemic individuals. A total of 204 healthy men and women with a serum TC concentration of 5.0-8.0 mmol/L participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel trial with 3 groups. A 4-wk preintervention period during which participants refrained from consuming hesperidin and naringin sources preceded the intervention. During the 4-wk intervention, the participants applied the same dietary restrictions and consumed 4 capsules/d providing either placebo (cellulose) or a daily dose of 800 mg hesperidin or 500 mg naringin. Blood samples to measure serum lipids were taken on 2 consecutive days at the beginning and end of the intervention phase. One hundred ninety-four participants completed the study. They maintained their prestudy body weights (mean changes lt 0.2 kg in all groups). In all groups, the mean consumption of scheduled capsules was gt 99%. Hesperidin and naringin did not affect TC or LDL-C, with endpoint LDL-C concentrations (adjusted for baseline) of 4.00 +/- 0.04, 3.99 +/- 0.04, and 3.99 +/- 0.04 mmol/L for control, hesperidin, and naringin groups, respectively. These citrus flavonoids also did not affect serum HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. In conclusion, pure hesperidin and naringin consumed in capsules at mealtime do not lower serum TC and LDL-C concentrations in moderately hypercholesterolemic men and women.

TI  - A randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of statins on skeletal muscle function and performance: rationale and study design.
AB  - Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are the most effective medications for reducing elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Statins reduce cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease and previously healthy persons. Current recommendations for LDL-C treatment goals indicate that more patients will be treated with higher doses of these medications. Statins have been extremely well-tolerated in controlled clinical trials but are increasingly recognized to produce skeletal muscle myalgia, cramps, and weakness. The reported frequency of such mild symptoms is not clear, and muscle performance has not been examined with these medications. Accordingly, the present investigation, the Effect of Statins on Skeletal Muscle Function and Performance (STOMP) study, will recruit approximately 440 healthy persons. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg/d or placebo. Handgrip, elbow and knee isometric and isokinetic strength, knee extensor endurance, and maximal aerobic exercise performance will be determined at baseline. Participants will undergo repeat testing after 6 months of treatment or after meeting the study definition of statin myalgia. This study will determine the effect of statins on skeletal muscle strength, endurance, and aerobic exercise performance and may ultimately help clinicians better evaluate statin-related muscle and exercise complaints.

TI  - Effects of simvastatin on proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in hypercholesterolemic individuals.
AB  - Statins are potent lipid-lowering drugs but anti-inflammatory effects have also been suggested. Our aim was to investigate the effects of simvastatin on proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Eighty hypercholesterolemic men were randomized to simvastatin 40 mg or placebo for 6 weeks. Simvastatin treatment significantly reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) levels while interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained unchanged. The ex vivo release of IL-1 and IL-6 was not altered by simvastatin, whereas the release of TNF- and IL-8 increased after 6 weeks of simvastatin treatment. Similarly, the circulating levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 remained unaffected by simvastatin while MMP-9 increased. However, none of the effects except for the CRP reduction within the simvastatin group reached statistical significance when compared to the placebo group. Our findings are in contrast to previous in vitro and animal data and question the in vivo relevance of some of the pleiotropic effects of simvastatin.

TI  - High-dose atorvastatin causes a rapid sustained increase in human serum PCSK9 and disrupts its correlation with LDL cholesterol.
AB  - Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key regulator of serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. PCSK9 is secreted by the liver into the plasma and binds the hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR), causing its subsequent degradation. We first demonstrated that a moderate dose of atorvastatin (40 mg) increases PCSK9 serum levels, suggesting why increasing statin doses may have diminished efficacy with regard to further LDL-C lowering. Since that initial observation, at least two other groups have reported statin-induced PCSK9 increases. To date, no analysis of the effect of high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg) on PCSK9 over time has been conducted. Therefore, we studied the time course of atorvastatin (80 mg) in human subjects. We measured PCSK9 and lipid levels during a 2-week lead-in baseline period and every 4 weeks thereafter for 16 weeks. We observed that atorvastatin (80 mg) caused a rapid 47% increase in serum PCSK9 at 4 weeks that was sustained throughout 16 weeks of dosing. Importantly, while PCSK9 levels were highly correlated with total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and triglyceride (TG) levels at baseline, atorvastatin (80 mg) completely abolished all of these correlations. Together, these results further suggest an explanation for why increasing doses of statins fail to achieve proportional LDL-C lowering.

TI  - Effects of simvastatin on cholesterol metabolism and Alzheimer disease biomarkers.
AB  - Preclinical and epidemiologic studies suggest a protective effect of statins on Alzheimer disease (AD). Experimental evidence indicates that some statins can cross the blood-brain barrier, alter brain cholesterol metabolism, and may ultimately decrease the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Despite these promising leads, clinical trials have yielded inconsistent results regarding the benefits of statin treatment in AD. Seeking to detect a biological signal of statins effect on AD, we conducted a 12-week open-label trial with simvastatin 40 mg/d and then 80 mg/d in 12 patients with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment and hypercholesterolemia. We quantified cholesterol precursors and metabolites and AD biomarkers of Abeta and tau in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid at baseline and after the 12-week treatment period. We found a modest but significant inhibition of brain cholesterol biosynthesis after simvastatin treatment, as indexed by a decrease of cerebrospinal fluid lathosterol and plasma 24S-hydroxycholesterol. Despite this effect, there were no changes in AD biomarkers. Our findings indicate that simvastatin treatment can affect brain cholesterol metabolism within 12 weeks, but did not alter molecular indices of AD pathology during this short-term treatment.

TI  - Influence of simvastatin on apoB-100 secretion in non-obese subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - Statins decrease apoB-100-containing lipoproteins by increasing their fractional catabolic rates through LDL receptor-mediated uptake. Their influence on hepatic secretion of these lipoproteins is controversial. The objective of the study was to examine the influence of simvastatin on the secretion of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins in fasting non-obese subjects. Turnover of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins was investigated using stable isotope-labeled tracers. Multicompartmental modeling was used to derive kinetic parameters. Eight male subjects (BMI 25 +/- 3 kg/m(2)) with mild hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol 135 +/- 30 mg/dL) and normal triglycerides (111 +/- 44 mg/dL) were examined under no treatment (A), under chronic treatment with simvastatin 40 mg/day (B) and after an acute-on-chronic dosage of 80 mg simvastatin under chronic simvastatin treatment (C). Lipoprotein concentrations changed as expected under 40 mg/day simvastatin. Fractional catabolic rates increased in IDL and LDL but not in VLDL fractions versus control [VLDL +35% in B (n.s.) and +21% in C (n.s.); IDL +169% in B (P = 0.08) and +187% in C (P = 0.032); LDL +87% in B (P = 0.025) and +133% in C (P = 0.025)]. Chronic (B) and acute-on-chronic simvastatin treatment (C) did not affect lipoprotein production rates [VLDL -8 and -13%, IDL +47 and +38%, and LDL +19 and +30% in B and C, respectively (all comparisons n.s.)]. The data indicate that simvastatin does not influence the secretion of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins in non-obese subjects with near-normal LDL cholesterol concentrations.

TI  - Effects of phytosterol ester-enriched low-fat milk on serum lipoprotein profile in mildly hypercholesterolaemic patients are not related to dietary cholesterol or saturated fat intake.
AB  - Phytosterols (PS) are recommended to reduce LDL-cholesterol. However, the influence of cholesterol and fat intake on the lipid-lowering effect of PS in mildly hypercholesterolaemia is unclear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the efficacy of PS is related to the composition of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol intake. Additionally, serum carotenoid content was analysed to evaluate to what extent it was undermined by PS. This was a 3-month randomised, parallel trial with a three-arm design. Patients were divided into three groups: healthy diet (n 24), healthy diet+PS (n 31) and free diet+PS (n 29), receiving 2 g/d of PS. Healthy and free diets were characterised by a daily ingestion of 6.8 % of saturated fat and 194.4 mg of cholesterol and 12.7 % of saturated fat and 268.1 mg of cholesterol, respectively. After PS therapy, patients receiving the healthy diet+PS or a free diet+PS exhibited a similar reduction in total cholesterol (6.7 and 5.5 %), LDL-cholesterol (9.6 and 7.0 %), non-HDL-cholesterol (12.2 and 8.9 %) and apo B-100/apo A-I ratio (11.5 and 11.6 %), respectively. In patients following the healthy diet, (-carotene concentration rose by 26.9 %, whereas the -carotene and lycopene levels dropped by 21.0 and 22.8 % in the group receiving the free diet+PS, respectively. No change was observed in carotenoid levels in healthy diet+PS group. In conclusion, the efficacy of PS in relation to lipoprotein profile is not influenced by saturated fat or dietary cholesterol intake, which confirms the positive effect of healthy diet therapy in improving the negative effects that PS exert on carotenoid levels.

TI  - Effect of moderate and high-dose simvastatin on asymmetric dimethylarginine-homocysteine metabolic pathways in patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - The assumption that statin therapy can decrease asymmetric dimethylarginine through lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels seems logical and yet arises some controversy. The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of moderate (40 mg) to high (80 mg) simvastatin doses on asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine levels in patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia (after target LDL-C levels, 2.6 mmol/L, are reached). The study included 120 adult patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol 7.5 mmol/L and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 4.9 mmol/L). Asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, total homocysteine-by a high-performance liquid chromatographic method. There was a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein-B levels as well as in the apolipoprotein-B/apolipoprotein-A1 index after a 1-month therapy with 40 mg simvastatin (P <0.001). Asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine levels were also decreased but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.571; P= 0.569). A dose-dependent effect was established, comparing the influence of moderate (40 mg) to high (80 mg) simvastatin doses on the tested atherogenic biomarkers (lipid profile, apolipoprotein-A1, and apolipoprotein-B). Asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine levels were lowered significantly with 80 mg simvastatin (P <0.001; P= 0.038). In conclusion, optimizing the target values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a moderate dose (40 mg) of simvastatin has no effect on asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine in contrast to a high dose (80 mg) after target LDL-C levels are reached (2.6 mmol/L) in patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Pitavastatin reduces lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 ligands in hypercholesterolemic humans.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the impact of pitavastatin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Twenty-five hypercholesterolemic patients (8 male, 17 female; age 66 +/- 13, 21-80 years) who had not received anti-dyslipidemic agents and had LDL-C levels of more than 160 mg/dL were examined. Biochemical factors were measured at baseline and after treatment with pitavastatin (2 mg/day) for 6 months. Serum levels of LOX-1 with apolipoprotein B-100 particle ligand and a soluble form of LOX-1 (sLOX-1) were measured by ELISA. All subjects completed the study with no adverse side effects. Total-C (268 +/- 26 vs. 176 +/- 17 mg/dL), LDL-C (182 +/- 21 vs. 96 +/- 14 mg/dL), and LOX-1 ligand (867 +/- 452 vs. 435 +/- 262 ng/mL) were reduced with pitavastatin treatment (P < 0.0001 for each). Significant decreases in triacylglycerols were noted (P < 0.0001), but there were no changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After 6 months, there were no significant changes in high-sensitivity CRP or soluble LOX-1. At baseline, there were no significant correlations between LOX-1 ligand and either LDL-C or sLOX-1. The decrease in LOX-1 ligand was not correlated with the decrease in LDL-C, but was correlated with the decrease in sLOX-1 (r = 0.47, P < 0.05). In conclusion, pitavastatin therapy had beneficial effects on markers of oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic subjects. Serum levels of LOX-1 ligand may be a useful biomarker of the pleiotropic effects of statins.

TI  - Atorvastatin increases blood ratios of vitamin E/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and coenzyme Q10/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic patients.
AB  - Statins are among the most widely used drugs in the management of hypercholesterolemia. In addition to inhibiting endogenous cholesterol synthesis, however, statins decrease coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) synthesis. CoQ10 has been reported to have antioxidant properties, and administration of drugs that decrease CoQ10 synthesis might lead to increased oxidative stress in vivo. Our present study examined the hypothesis that atorvastatin increased oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic patients due to its inhibition of CoQ10 synthesis. We investigated the effects of atorvastatin (10 mg/d) administration for 5 months on lowering hypercholesterolemia and blood antioxidant status. The study population included 19 hypercholesterolemic outpatients. Blood levels of lipid and antioxidant markers, consisting of vitamin C, vitamin E, CoQ10, and glutathione (GSH), and urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were examined pre- and postadministration of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin administration resulted in a significant decrease in blood levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, vitamin E, and CoQ10 (P < .05); however, a significant increase in the ratios of vitamin E/LDL cholesterol and CoQ10/LDL cholesterol was noted (P < .05). Atorvastatin had no significant effect on red blood cell (RBC) level of GSH and urinary 8-OHdG. The present study provides evidence that atorvastatin exerts a hypocholesterolemic effect, but on the basis of the urinary level of 8-OHdG and the blood ratios of vitamin E/LDL cholesterol and CoQ10/LDL cholesterol, has no oxidative stress-inducing effect.

TI  - Design and rationale of a real-life study to compare treatment strategies for cardiovascular risk factors: the CRUCIAL study.
AB  - The CRUCIAL trial was designed to compare the relative reduction in calculated Framingham coronary heart disease risk when a multiple risk factor intervention strategy, based on single-pill amlodipine besylate/atorvastatin calcium, was compared with a usual-care strategy. Eligible patients had treated or untreated hypertension, >or=3 additional cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline total cholesterol<or=6.5 mmol/L, but no coronary heart disease. The CRUCIAL trial was a 12-month, international, multicenter, prospective, stratified, cluster-randomized, parallel-design, open-label trial conducted in 20 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America. We anticipate the results of this study will be available in mid to late 2010. In this article we report the rationale for and design of the CRUCIAL trial and discuss how the challenges in the design and conduct of this cluster-randomized trial were addressed. The cluster-randomized trial design, with the investigator as the unit of randomization, was chosen to minimize contamination between the trial arms. The intent of the study was to compare the new therapeutic strategy with customary treatment practices, so no recommendation was made regarding the choice of antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs in the usual-care arm. It was considered that if the investigator managed both arms of the trial it would be difficult to prevent crossover of treatment strategies. Patients were enrolled in the study before the investigators were randomized to avoid selection bias. Investigators were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within each country to explicitly balance the treatment arms with respect to potential confounding factors. The cluster effect was taken into account in the sample size calculation. The findings from the CRUCIAL trial have the potential to inform current thinking on how to effectively reduce the cardiovascular risk of patients with hypertension and additional risk factors but only modestly elevated total cholesterol.

TI  - Effects of concomitant therapy with diltiazem on the lipid responses to simvastatin in Chinese subjects.
AB  - Diltiazem increases systemic exposure to simvastatin via inhibition of CYP3A. This study assessed the impact of this interaction on the lipid-lowering effects of simvastatin. Chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomized to receive simvastatin 20 mg daily alone or together with diltiazem 60 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks with a washout period of 4 weeks in an open-label, crossover study. Blood pressure, fasting serum lipid profile, and safety tests were determined at baseline and after each treatment period. Trough serum diltiazem was measured at the end of the 4-week combination treatment. In the 30 patients who completed the study, simvastatin treatment significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by mean ( standard error) 41.0%  2.2% (P < .001), and the combination with diltiazem showed an additional reduction of 1.66% (95% confidence interval: -4.63 to 7.96, P > .05). The additional change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with diltiazem showed a nonsignificant positive correlation with the trough serum diltiazem concentration (R(2) = 0.142, P = .058). Co-administration of diltiazem 60 mg 3 times daily with simvastatin 20 mg daily tended to increase the changes in lipid parameters in these Chinese subjects, but the effects did not reach significance.

TI  - ABCG2 polymorphism is associated with the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to rosuvastatin.
AB  - The ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) c.421C>A (rs2231142) polymorphism influences the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin. We examined whether this polymorphism influences the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering efficacy of the drug. In 305 Chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia who were treated with rosuvastatin at a dosage of 10 mg daily, the c.421A variant was found to be significantly associated with greater reduction in LDL-C level, in a gene-dose-dependent manner. As compared with subjects with the c.421CC genotype, those with the c.421AA genotype showed a 6.9% greater reduction in LDL-C level, which would be equivalent to the effect obtained by doubling the dose of rosuvastatin.

TI  - Hypotensive medication, statins, and the risk of glaucoma.
AB  - PURPOSE. To examine whether treatment with oral blood-pressure-lowering medication or statins influences the risk of glaucoma. METHODS. This study was a case-control investigation, nested within a computerized primary care database of 177 general practices across the United Kingdom; 8778 cases diagnosed and/or treated for glaucoma between 2000 and 2007, and 8778 glaucoma-free controls matched for age, sex, and practice. Odds ratios for treatment with oral antihypertensives (including selective beta(1) and nonselective beta-blockers) and statins in the 5 years before diagnosis were calculated by logistic regression, adjusted for a marker of socioeconomic position and number of drug types prescribed (as a measure of health service usage). RESULTS. Prevalence of oral beta-blocker use in the 5 years before diagnosis was lower in the cases (22.5%) than in the controls (23.6%), adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.94). This effect was presence with treatment with beta(1)-selective medications (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.88) but not with nonselective medications (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94-1.24). The prevalence of thiazide use was higher among the glaucoma cases than among the controls (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.23). Neither statins nor other antihypertensive treatments were associated with the risk of glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS. Oral beta(1) beta-blockers may protect against development of glaucoma. The current consensus on the relative importance of beta(2) receptor blockade in treating glaucoma may have to be reviewed. Changes in prescribing oral beta-blockers for cardiovascular disorders may affect the number of those who eventually have glaucoma. There is no evidence to suggest that statins have a preventive role in glaucoma.

TI  - A multicenter study in Malaysia to determine the efficacy and safety of a generic atorvastatin.
AB  - A multicenter study was conducted to assess the efficacy of a generic form of Atorvastatin (Ranbaxy's Storvas) in the treatment of Primary Hypercholesterolemia. One hundred and nineteen patients were given 10 mg of Storvas for four weeks and increased to 20 mg if target LDL-Cholesterol was not achieved. LDL-Cholesterol was reduced by 36.6% at four weeks and 37.5% at eight weeks from baseline. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly reduced. There were no drug-related serious adverse events. We conclude that the generic atorvastatin is safe and effective in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia and the results are comparable to published data on innovator atorvastatin.

TI  - Combined treatment with Dif1stat and diet reduce plasma lipid indicators of moderate hypercholesterolemia more effectively than diet alone: a randomized trial in parallel groups.
AB  - An open-labeled randomized trial with parallel groups was carried out to study the effects of Dif1stat (Monascus purpureus-Linear aliphatic alcohols-Niacin) in the treatment of primary moderate hypercholesterolemia. The trial lasted 8 months. The patients, males and females, were assigned to two groups: A (#130), treated with diet, and B (#110) submitted to diet + Dif1stat. After 4 months, group A did not show significant changes in Total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDLC), HDL-cholesterol (HDLC) or non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDLC). The same group, showed a reduction in TC (-22%), LDLC (-30%) and non-HDLC (-27%) after 8 months (P < or = 0.001). After 4 months, TC (-21.3%), LDLC (-29%), and non-HDLC (-26%) were significantly lowered in group B (P < or = 0.001). In group B, TC, LDLC and non-HDLC showed a further reduction after 8 months: -29.4, -38 and -37%, respectively (P < or = 0.001). Even triglycerides (TG) decreased significantly (-33%) (P < or = 0.001). After 8 months, group B showed a significant reduction of TG (-33%) (P < or = 0.001), when compared to group A. Some safety parameters were significantly reduced in both groups: AST and gamma-GT in group A after 4 and 8 months, as well as ALT, AST and gamma-GT in group B after 8 months (P < or = 0.001). Dif1stat, given with a suitable diet, was well tolerated in the long-term and induced an anti-atherogenic plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile, in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Effects of increasing the dose of pravastatin on serum adiponectin level in Japanese mild hypercholesterolemic and hypertensive patients.
AB  - The plasma level of adiponectin (CAS 1070484-33-1), known as an anti-atherogenic adipocytokine, inversely correlates with the progression of atherosclerosis. The reported effects of statins on the serum level of adiponectin include significant increases in the adiponectin levels caused by pravastatin (CAS 81131-70-6). In this study, increasing the dosage of pravastatin was investigated to determine whether it had a clearly favorable effect on the adiponectin level in hypercholesterolemic patients. A total of 26 mild hypercholesterolemic and hypertensive patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were initially treated with pravastatin 10 mg/day for 6 months or more, and then increased to pravastatin 20 mg/day. Serum adiponectin, cholesterol fractionated components, and lipoprotein components were evaluated after 6 months. Increasing the dose of pravastatin from 10 to 20 mg/day caused the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to decrease (from 130 to 104 mg/dL, p < 0.001), and thereafter the serum adiponectin levels, particularly the high-molecular-weight adiponectin levels significantly increased (from 10.9 to 12.6 microg/mL, p = 0.022; from 6.6 to 7.6 microg/mL, p = 0.022, respectively). Pravastatin increased the serum adiponectin level after increasing the dosage from 10 to 20 mg/day. It remains possible, however, that the difference was due not only to pharmacologic effects, but also to other specific characteristics such as the subject characteristics, viz.; race, body size, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, etc.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of milk fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus 145 and Bifidobacterium longum BB536 on plasma lipids in a sample of adult women. A double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study (two periods of four weeks each separated by a 1-week washout period) was performed in 34 women, aged between 18 and 65 years. Group A consumed 125 g fermented milk three times a day for the first 4 weeks while group B consumed regular yoghurt under the same conditions. (Groups A and B switched products for the second treatment period). Women taking the test product with a baseline total cholesterol above 190 mg/dl showed a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol. HDL cholesterol was also reduced by the test product. We conclude that the fermented milk may help to reduce LDL levels in hypercholesterolemic adult women.

TI  - Intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy improves large artery elasticity in acute myocardial infarction patients.
AB  - This study was aimed at probing the effects of intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy with simvastatin on the large artery elasticity of acute myocardial infarction patients. A total of 72 cases of acute myocardial infarction patients were divided into a normocholesterol group (n = 37) and a hypercholesterol group (n = 35) according to their serum low-density lipoprotein. All patients were given oral simvastatin 40 mg/day for 6 months, and their pulse-wave velocity (PWV) of different artery segments and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were measured before and after the therapy. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in both groups decreased significantly (2.13 +/- 0.32 vs 1.56 +/- 0.28, 3.43 +/- 0.80 vs 2.28 +/- 0.47 mmol/l, P < 0.01). The PWV of each artery segment in both the normocholesterol group and the hypercholesterol group decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Pulse-wave velocity in the hypercholesterol group was lowered much more than that of the normocholesterol group (P < 0.05). There were no differences among each artery segment in each group. Ankle-brachial index increased significantly in both groups (1.12 +/- 0.16 to 1.22 +/- 0.12, P < 0.05 in the normocholesterol group, and 1.03 +/- 0.22 to 1.23 +/- 0.16, P < 0.01 in the hypercholesterol group), but ABI increased much more in the hypercholesterol group than in the normocholesterol group (0.21 + 0.15 vs 0.11 + 0.09 P = 0.02). Intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy with simvastatin for acute myocardial infarction patients can significantly improve their large artery elasticity and regress their atherosclerosis. Hypercholesterol patients benefit more from this therapy.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of the effect of statins on blood pressure control in hypertensive patients in clinical practice.
AB  - Our study suggests a BP-lowering effect of statins, consistent with some other literature. Some parameters like age, baseline systolic blood pressure and cholesterolemia influence the antihypertensive effect of statins. The lack of consideration for these confounding factors may be one of the reasons for the conflicting results about the BP lowering effects of statins.

TI  - Applicability of non-cholesterol sterols in predicting response in cholesterol metabolism to simvastatin and fluvastatin treatment among hypercholesterolemic men.
AB  - Low serum baseline ratios to cholesterol of lathosterol, cholestenol and desmosterol, but a high ratio of cholestanol predicted a poor response to statins. Good responders were characterized by more profound reductions of serum and fecal (lathosterol) precursor sterols and increases of serum absorption marker sterol ratios on statins. Serum surrogate sterol markers of cholesterol metabolism were applicable in evaluating cholesterol absorption and synthesis also on statins.

TI  - Correlation of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with apolipoprotein B during simvastatin + fenofibrate therapy in patients with combined hyperlipidemia (a subanalysis of the SAFARI trial).
AB  - Guidelines have recommended non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol as a secondary target for therapy after the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals have been met in patients with hypertriglyceridemia; non-HDL cholesterol is viewed as a surrogate for apolipoprotein (Apo)B, an alternate end point of treatment. The present analysis of the previously reported Simvastatin plus Fenofibrate for Combined Hyperlipidemia (SAFARI) trial assessed the associations of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with ApoB levels in patients with combined hyperlipidemia treated with combination simvastatin (20 mg) and fenofibrate (160 mg) or simvastatin monotherapy (20 mg). The correlations of these factors were analyzed in the overall modified intent-to-treat population (n = 594) and in patient subgroups stratified by triglyceride (TG) tertiles. Simvastatin plus fenofibrate and simvastatin alone significantly reduced LDL cholesterol, TG, non-HDL cholesterol and ApoB levels and non-HDL cholesterol/ApoB ratio (p < or =0.0004), regardless of the TG level. The greatest reductions occurred with combination treatment. The baseline levels of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol correlated highly with ApoB and were stronger in the lower TG tertiles than in the higher TG tertiles. After 12 weeks, the correlations had changed little with simvastatin monotherapy but had increased substantially with combination therapy and were most improved at high TG levels. In conclusion, these results suggest that both non-HDL cholesterol and ApoB provide similar information in relation to treatment response in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and that non-HDL cholesterol is a good indicator of ApoB-containing lipoproteins, supporting its recommended use as a secondary therapeutic target in these patients.

TI  - Predicting benefit from statins by C-reactive protein, LDL-cholesterol or absolute cardiovascular risk.
AB  - Evaluation of: Ridker PM, Danielson E, Fonseca FA et al.: Rosuvastatin to prevent vascular events in men and women with elevated C-reactive protein. N. Engl. J. Med. 359, 2195-2207 (2008). The Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) randomized nearly 18,000 subjects with no history of cardiovascular disease and an average or low LDLcholesterol level (<3.4 mmol/l), but a high plasma level of C-reactive protein (CRP; >2 mg/dl), to rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo daily. The trial was stopped early because of a highly statistically significant 46% reduction in cardiovascular events for patients randomized to rosuvastatin. Participants who achieved an LDL-cholesterol level lower than 1.8 mmol/l and a CRP level lower than 2 mg/dl on treatment had the greatest decrease in cardiovascular risk. The JUPITER trial provides evidence that the benefits of statins relate in part to decreased inflammation. Comparison with other statin trials indicates that absolute cardiovascular risk is an important predictor of benefit from statin treatment, and potent statins that result in a greater percentage reduction in LDLcholesterol and CRP are likely to reduce risk more. Targeting statin treatment based on LDL-cholesterol alone will not provide an optimal risk reduction for many individuals.

TI  - Effects of AT1 receptor and beta1 receptor blocking on blood pressure, peripheral hemodynamic and lipid profile in statin-treated hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients.
AB  - Recent evidences suggest a relationship between angiotensin 1 (AT1) receptor gene expression and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) plasma level. We enrolled 16 untreated hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients (57.4 +/- 7 years old) in a randomized, single-blind, cross-over design. All the patients were allocated to treatment with simvastatin 20 mg/day for 2 weeks, then randomly assigned to telmisartan (40-80 mg/day) or bisoprolol (5-10 mg/day). After 4 weeks the antihypertensive drugs have been withdrawn for a wash-out period of 2 weeks when they were treated with simvastatin alone, then they have been allocated to the alternative antihypertensive treatment for four additional weeks. We measured: systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), 24-h mean BP (MBP), Baseline and post-ischemia forearm blood flow (FBF) and vascular resistance (FVR), and Lipid profile. After 2 weeks of treatment with Simvastatin, baseline and post-ischemic FBF increased (both P < 0.05), while baseline and post-ischemic FVR decreased (both P < 0.05). Standing DBP and MBP were reduced more after treatment with telmisartan than with bisoprolol (P < 0.05). Basal and post-ischemic FBF were significantly increased (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively) and basal and post-ischemic FVR significantly decreased (both P < 0.005) only after treatment with telmisartan, as well as plasma triglycerides (TG) (P < 0.05). From this preliminary study carried out on hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients it appears that the association of telmisartan and simvastatin (but not of bisoprolol and simvastatin) could exert positive effects on a large quantity of vascular functionality parameters, just after a short treatment.

TI  - Lipid-altering efficacy and safety of ezetimibe/simvastatin versus atorvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia and the metabolic syndrome (from the VYMET study).
AB  - Patients with the metabolic syndrome are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and might require intensive lipid therapy. Many patients remain at the starting dose of lipid therapy and might not be titrated up to a higher dose. The present double-blind, randomized, 6-week study assessed the lipid-lowering efficacy of ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg versus atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg, and ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg versus atorvastatin 40 mg in 1,128 patients with hypercholesterolemia and the metabolic syndrome. The primary end point was the percentage of change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Additional end points included changes in other lipids, lipoprotein ratios, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and attainment of prespecified lipid levels. Significantly greater improvements in the levels of LDL cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipid/lipoprotein ratios resulted with ezetimibe/simvastatin compared with atorvastatin at all specified dose comparisons (p <0.001). The attainment of prespecified LDL cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was also significantly greater with ezetimibe/simvastatin than with atorvastatin at all dose comparisons (p <0.05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increases were significantly greater with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg than with atorvastatin 10 mg (p <0.05) and ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg than with atorvastatin 40 mg (p <0.01). The changes in triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were similar for both treatments. The incidence of liver, muscle, and gastrointestinal-, hepatitis- and allergic reaction/rash-related adverse events were low and generally similar to those in previous studies of ezetimibe/simvastatin and/or atorvastatin. In conclusion, ezetimibe/simvastatin was more likely to result in lipid treatment end points than atorvastatin and was generally well tolerated at the doses compared in our patients.

TI  - Stearate-enriched plant sterol esters lower serum LDL cholesterol concentration in normo- and hypercholesterolemic adults.
AB  - Studies in our laboratory have previously demonstrated in hamsters a superior cholesterol-lowering ability of plant sterol (PS) esters enriched in stearate compared with linoleate. We therefore conducted a randomized, double-blind, 2-group parallel, placebo-controlled study to test the cholesterol-lowering properties of stearate-enriched PS esters in normo- and hypercholesterolemic adults. Thirty-two adults, 16 per group with equal number of males and females in each group, participated in the 4-wk study. Participants consumed 3 g/d (1 g three times per day with meals) of either PS esters or placebo delivered in capsules. Serum LDL cholesterol concentration significantly decreased 0.42 mmol/L (11%) and the LDL:HDL cholesterol ratio decreased 10% with PS ester supplementation, whereas LDL particle size and lipoprotein subclass particle concentrations (as measured by NMR) were not affected. The percent change in LDL cholesterol was positively correlated with baseline lathosterol concentration (r = 0.729; P = 0.0014), indicating an association between the magnitude of LDL change and the rate of whole-body cholesterol synthesis. Serum campesterol (but not sitosterol) concentration significantly increased in the PS ester group. Serum tocopherol, retinol, and beta-carotene concentrations were not affected by PS ester supplementation. Thus, our findings demonstrate the usefulness of a novel stearate-enriched PS ester compound in decreasing LDL cholesterol in both normo- and hypercholesterolemic adults. The extent to which PS ester fatty acid composition affects intestinal micelle formation and cholesterol absorption in humans requires further study.

AB  - Ezetimibe/simvastatin reduced the cholesterol content of most lipoprotein subclasses from baseline with generally similar efficacy in patients with low and high TGs. Despite the different mechanism of action of ezetimibe, the response to ezetimibe/simvastatin and atorvastatin treatment related to these lipoprotein subclasses was generally consistent with the overall effects of these therapies on the major lipid/lipoprotein classes. The clinical significance of these results awaits further study.

TI  - Appropriateness of cholesterol management in primary care by sex and level of cardiovascular risk.
AB  - A study was undertaken to ascertain the appropriateness of lipid screening and management per the Third Report of the Adult Treatment Panel National Cholesterol Education Program (ATP III) guideline in a sample of North Carolina primary care practices. Demographics, cholesterol values, and comorbid conditions were abstracted from the medical records from 60 community practices participating in a randomized practice-based trial (Guideline Adherence for Heart Health). Eligible patients were aged 21 to 84 years, seen during the baseline period of June 1, 2001, through May 31, 2003, and who were not taking lipid-lowering therapy. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess whether age, sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, ATP III risk category, or pretreatment low-density lipoprotein (LDL) influenced treatment. Among 5031 eligible patients, 1711 (34.5%) received screening lipid profiles. Screening rates were higher with older age, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. No large differences were seen by sex. Among patients screened (mean age, 51.6 years; 57.9% female), 76.6% were appropriately managed within 4 months. In adjusted analyses, older age was associated with less appropriate treatment (odds ratio [OR] per 5 years, 0.91; P=.01), and patients with LDL cholesterol <or=130 mg/dL (OR, 18.8; P<.001) and the low-risk group (OR, 27.5; P<.001) were more likely to be managed appropriately compared with patients with LDL >or=190 mg/dL and those at high risk. Among 375 patients eligible for drug treatment, those with LDL levels between 131 and 159 mg/dL were much less likely to be treated (OR, 0.15; P<.001) compared with those with LDL >190 mg/dL, whereas risk category did not influence treatment. The challenge facing implementation of ATP III guidelines is much greater for intermediate- and high-risk patients than for low-risk patients.

TI  - Consuming functional foods enriched with plant sterol or stanol esters for 85 weeks does not affect neurocognitive functioning or mood in statin-treated hypercholesterolemic individuals.
AB  - Recent animal and human studies have shown that plant sterols and stanols, which are used as functional food ingredients to lower increased LDL cholesterol concentrations, pass the blood-brain barrier. Whether this affects neurocognitive functioning and mental well-being in humans has, to our knowledge, never been investigated. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the effects of long-term plant sterol or stanol consumption on neurocognitive functioning and mood in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary intervention trial. To this end, hypercholesterolemic individuals, aged 43-69 y, receiving stable statin treatment were randomly assigned to an 85-wk supplementation with margarines enriched with plant sterol esters (2.5 g/d), plant stanol esters (2.5 g/d), or placebo. At baseline and at the end of the intervention period, all participants underwent a cognitive assessment. In addition, subjective cognitive functioning and mood were assessed by means of questionnaires (Cognitive Failure Questionnaire and depression subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90, respectively). Long-term supplementation with plant sterol or stanol esters did not affect cognitive performance (memory, simple information processing speed, complex information processing speed, Letter-Digit Substitution test performance), subjective cognitive functioning, or mood. In conclusion, the present results indicate that long-term use of plant sterols or stanols at recommended intakes of 2.5 g/d does not affect neurocognitive functioning or mood in hypercholesterolemic individuals receiving statin treatment.

TI  - The effects of dietary cholesterol-lowering on psychological symptoms: a randomised controlled study.
AB  - The relationship of plasma cholesterol-reducing interventions to emotional states, such as depression and hostility, remains a topic of debate. The present study employed a randomised, controlled design, and was conducted at a clinical research center to test the effect of dietary cholesterol-lowering on psychological symptoms. Ten women and eight men were randomly assigned to one of two counterbalanced diet cycles (low-fat versus high-fat diet; isocaloric; 6 weeks each; separated by a washout period). Analyses for repeated measures revealed that the low-fat diet significantly reduced total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, when compared with baseline and the high-fat diet. As expected, weight remained unchanged. Ratings of depression, hostility and global severity of psychological symptoms as measured by the SCL-90-R also improved significantly on the low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet when compared with baseline. These results suggest that plasma cholesterol-lowering in the context of a low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diet may have a beneficial effect on psychological symptoms.

TI  - Adding exercise training to rosuvastatin treatment: influence on serum lipids and biomarkers of muscle and liver damage.
AB  - Statin treatment and exercise training can improve lipid profile when administered separately. The efficacy of exercise and statin treatment combined, and its impact on myalgia and serum creatine kinase (CK) have not been completely addressed. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of statin treatment and the addition of exercise training on lipid profile, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and levels of CK and alanine transaminase. Thirty-one hypercholesterolemic and physically inactive subjects were randomly assigned to rosuvastatin (R) or rosuvastatin/exercise (RE) group. A third group of physically active hypercholesterolemic subjects served as an active control group (AC). The R and RE groups received rosuvastatin treatment (10 mg/d) for 20 weeks. From week 10 to week 20, the RE group also participated in a combined endurance and resistive exercise training program (3 d/wk). Lipid profile was determined for all subjects at week 0 (Pre), week 10 (Mid), and week 20 (Post). The CK and alanine transaminase levels were measured at the same time points in the RE and R groups and 48 hours after the first and fifth exercise bout in the RE group. Each RE subject was formally queried about muscle fatigue, soreness, and stiffness before each training session. Total, LDL, and oxLDL cholesterol was lower in the RE and R groups at Mid and Post time points when compared with Pre. Oxidized LDL was lower in the RE group compared with the R group at the Post time point. When treatment groups (R and RE) were combined, high-density lipoprotein levels were increased and triglycerides decreased across time. Creatine kinase increased in the RE group 48 hours after the first exercise bout, but returned to baseline levels 48 hours after the fifth exercise bout. Rosuvastatin treatment decreased total, LDL, and oxLDL cholesterol. The addition of an exercise training program resulted in a further decrease in oxLDL. There was no abnormal sustained increase in CK or reports of myalgia after the addition of exercise training to rosuvastatin treatment.

TI  - Changes in cholesterol absorption and cholesterol synthesis caused by ezetimibe and/or simvastatin in men.
AB  - This study evaluates changes in cholesterol balance in hypercholesterolemic subjects following treatment with an inhibitor of cholesterol absorption or cholesterol synthesis or coadministration of both agents. This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, four-period crossover study to evaluate the effects of coadministering 10 mg ezetimibe with 20 mg simvastatin (ezetimibe/simvastatin) on cholesterol absorption and synthesis relative to either drug alone or placebo in 41 subjects. Each treatment period lasted 7 weeks. Ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin decreased fractional cholesterol absorption by 65% and 59%, respectively (P < 0.001 for both relative to placebo). Simvastatin did not significantly affect cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin increased fecal sterol excretion (corrected for dietary cholesterol), which also represents net steady state cholesterol synthesis, by 109% and 79%, respectively (P < 0.001). Ezetimibe, simvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin decreased plasma LDL-cholesterol by 20, 38, and 55%, respectively. The coadministered therapy was well tolerated. The decreases in net cholesterol synthesis and increased fecal sterol excretion yielded nearly additive reductions in LDL-cholesterol for the coadministration of ezetimibe and simvastatin.

TI  - Sugar cane policosanols do not reduce LDL oxidation in hypercholesterolemic individuals.
AB  - Sugar cane policosanols (SCP) have been shown to exert antioxidant properties in various studies conducted in Cuba. Independent studies have since reported no significant effect of SCP consumption on oxidized LDL levels. The objective of the present study was to confirm the effects of Cuban SCP on LDL oxidation using a high-precision capture ELISA procedure in hypercholesterolemic individuals. Twenty-one otherwise healthy hypercholesterolemic men and post-menopausal women participated in a randomized double blind crossover study where they received 10 mg/day of policosanol or a placebo incorporated in margarine as an evening snack for a period of 28 days. Subjects maintained their usual dietary and exercise habits throughout the duration of the study. Blood was collected on the first as well as the last 2 days of the trial. LDL oxidation was measured from plasma using a solid phase two-site enzyme immunoassay. A lack of effect of SCP was observed on LDL cholesterol levels, as well as no difference in LDL oxidation between the SCP treatment and placebo at the end of the intervention period. Subject body weights remained stable throughout the study and showed no significant correlation with LDL oxidation levels. Absolute levels of plasma LDL cholesterol were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with plasma concentrations of oxidized LDL. The findings of the present study suggest that SCP do not significantly affect LDL oxidation. Our results align with results of recent policosanol research questioning the efficacy of these natural extracts as cardio-protective agents.

TI  - Independent and interactive effects of plant sterols and fish oil n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids on the plasma lipid profile of mildly hyperlipidaemic Indian adults.
AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the independent and interactive effects of a once-a-day yoghurt drink providing 2 g plant sterols/d and capsules providing 2 g fish oil n-3 long-chain (LC) PUFA/d on plasma lipids, apolipoproteins and LDL particle size. Following a 2-week run-in period, 200 mildly hypercholesterolaemic Indian adults aged 35-55 years were randomised into one of four groups of a 2 x 2 factorial, double-blind controlled trial. The 4-week treatments consisted of (1) control yoghurt drink and control capsules, (2) control yoghurt drink and fish oil capsules, (3) plant sterol-enriched yoghurt drink and control capsules, or (4) plant sterol-enriched yoghurt drink and fish oil capsules. Blood was drawn before and after the 4-week intervention. Changes in health status, lifestyle and dietary habits, and daily compliance were recorded. The main effects of plant sterols were a 4.5 % reduction in LDL-cholesterol and a 15 % reduction in TAG without a significant change in HDL-cholesterol. Overall, fish oil n-3 LC-PUFA did not significantly affect cholesterol concentrations but reduced TAG by 15 % and increased HDL-cholesterol by 5.4 %. The combination significantly lowered TAG by 15 % v. control. No significant interaction between plant sterols and n-3 LC-PUFA was observed on plasma cholesterol concentrations. In conclusion, once-a-day intake of 2 g plant sterols/d in a yoghurt drink, 2 g fish oil n-3 LC-PUFA/d in capsules, and their combination had beneficial effects on the lipid profile of mildly hypercholesterolaemic Indian adults. The potent hypotriacylglycerolaemic effect of plant sterols observed in the present study and this population warrants additional investigation.

TI  - Analysis of skeletal status by quantitative ultrasonometry in a cohort of postmenopausal women with high blood cholesterol without documented osteoporosis.
AB  - Osteoporosis and atherosclerosis are leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the Western world. A link between osteoporosis and atherosclerosis was proposed by epidemiologic and laboratory data. In the present study, we investigated skeletal status in postmenopausal women with hypercholesterolemia using quantitative ultrasonometry (QUS). Six hundred healthy postmenopausal subjects were enrolled within a 2-mo period by primary care physicians. Information on lifestyle and calcium intake was collected for each enrolled subject. Subjects (n = 256) were divided into two groups according to lipid profile: normal (n = 180) with serum cholesterol <200 mg/dL and hypercholesterolemic (n = 76) with serum cholesterol >or=200 mg/dL. Hypercholesterolemic subjects were further stratified into two groups, one receiving dietary treatment (n = 34) and the other receiving statin treatment (n = 42). We found a statistically significant reduction in amplitude dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) in hypercholesterolemic subjects compared with subjects with normal cholesterol (p = 0.006). Calcium intake behaved similarly to AD-SoS (p = 0.0001). No statistical significant difference in AD-SoS were observed between the group on diet treatment versus the group on statin (p = 0.52). Calcium intake was lower in patients on statins treatment compared with subjects on diet treatment only (p < 0.0001). Our data suggest that hypercholesterolemia per se is a risk factor for impaired skeletal status. Our data also call attention to the risk of a poor calcium intake in patient receiving diet to lower plasma cholesterol. Moreover, our data suggest that statins per se may exert a protective effect on bone independently from calcium intake.

TI  - Influence of short-term rosuvastatin therapy on endothelial progenitor cells and endothelial function.
AB  - Endothelial progenitor cells maintain endothelium integrity by replacing injured endothelial cells. Cholesterol-lowering promotes either endothelial progenitor cells mobilization or improves endothelial function. It is unknown whether improving endothelial function with statin is associated with a parallel increased endothelial progenitor cells availability. Thirty-two hypercholesterolemic patients were assigned to 4-week rosuvastatin (10 mg daily) and 16 hypercholesterolemic served as controls. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells, brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilatation, an index of endothelial function, and the lipid profile were measured before and after the 4-week statin therapy. At baseline, we found a correlation between circulating endothelial progenitor cells and flow-mediated vasodilatation (r = .31, P = .029). At the end of the 4-week intervention with rosuvastatin there was a 37% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .001) and a significant 72% increase in the number of endothelial progenitor cells and flow-mediated vasodilatation (4.7 + 0.7% to 8.8 + 0.4%, P < .001). Endothelial progenitor cells and flow-mediated vasodilatation were unchanged at the end of the study in patients not taking statin. A correlation emerged between endothelial progenitor cells and flow-mediated vasodilatation variations (r = .52, P < .001), this correlation being still significant after controlling for blood cholesterol reduction. In conclusion, short-term rosuvastatin therapy contributes in hyperchoelsterolemic patients to improving endothelial function by lowering cholesterol and increasing the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells; the latter effect appears to be partly independent from reduction in plasma cholesterol.

TI  - Should high creatine kinase discourage the initiation or continuance of statins for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia?
AB  - Patients with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and asymptomatic high creatine kinase (CK) (>or=250 but <2500 IU/L, 10x the laboratory upper normal limit [UNL]) are often not started on statins or have statins stopped because of concern about myositis-rhabdomyolysis. In the current report, we prospectively examined the hypothesis that asymptomatic patients with high CK (>or=250 but <2500 IU/L) tolerate statins well at doses reducing LDLC to target, less than 100 mg/dL, without development of myalgia-myositis. We assessed outcomes of 3 groups of patients referred to us because of asymptomatic high CK (>or=250 but <2500 IU/L)--1 group (n = 29) on statins at referral and continued on statins, 1 group (n = 20) not on statins and started on statins, and 1 group (n = 19) not on statins and not given statins--all restudied 1 month after entry and then every 3 months. Of the 68 patients, 59 (87%) had CK greater than 1 to 3 times the UNL, 7 (10%) had CK greater than 3 to 5 times the UNL, and 2 (3%) had CK greater than 5 to 10 times the UNL. After 1.2 months of follow-up in 29 statin-->statin patients, median CK fell from 353 to 301 (P = .0018) and was 287 (P = .015) after 4 months. After 1.3 months of follow-up in 20 no statin-->statin patients, median CK fell from 397 to 292 (P = .0094) and was 419 after 4.1 months. After 1.1 months of follow-up in 19 no statin-->no statin patients, median CK fell from 392 to 323 (P = .14) and was 271 (P = .029) after 4.2 months. By repeated-measures analysis, there were no differences in entry CK among the 3 treatment groups; CK fell (P = .04) in the no statin-->no statin patients. Despite high baseline CK (48 patients with CK 1-5x the UNL, 1 with CK 5-10x UNL), no patients during follow-up on statins developed CK greater than 10 times the UNL (2500 IU/L), none discontinued statins or reduced statin dose because of myalgia-myositis, and there was no rhabdomyolysis. High pretreatment CK, particularly 1 to 5 times the UNL, should not be an impediment to start or continue statins to lower LDLC.

TI  - A randomized, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group trial to compare the efficacy and safety profile of daming capsule in patients with hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - To study the efficacy and tolerability of Daming capsule (DMC) in Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia, a randomized, multi-centre, open-label, parallel-group trial was conducted. Sixty enrolled patients with hyperlipidemia allocated to six medical centers were randomly divided into two groups of 30 individuals each. One group received DMC 2 g b.i.d. for 6 weeks, and the other received pravastatin 10 mg o.d. for 6 weeks. For efficacy assessment, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured before and after drug treatment. Serum TC and LDL-C levels in the DMC-treatment group were significantly decreased compared with those before treatment (p < 0.05), while TG and HDL-C levels did not change much. Tolerability was assessed by heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (Cr), which were not changed in either the DMC or pravastatin groups at 3 and 6 weeks (p > 0.05). Besides, eight patients experienced diarrhea during DMC treatment and two experienced myalgia and epigastric discomfort during pravastatin treatment. Based on the above results, it was concluded that DMC may be a good candidate for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and further clinical trials are warranted.

TI  - High density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I are persistently elevated during long-term treatment with pitavastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.
AB  - Although a low level of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease, few available agents are capable of significantly increasing HDL-C. This multicenter study demonstrated that administration of pitavastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, significantly and persistently increased HDL-C (from 36.0+/-5.9 to 40.5+/-9.1 mg/dL: p<0.001) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (from 108.4+/-18.0 to 118.7+/-19.3 mg/dL: p<0.01) in 43 hypercholesterolemic patients with low HDL-C over the course of 12 months of treatment. This suggests that pitavastatin may contribute to reduction in coronary heart disease.

TI  - Antihypercholesterolemic effect of Chinese black tea extract in human subjects with borderline hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - A water-soluble extract of a traditional Chinese black tea (Pu-Ehr) has been shown to precipitate mixed bile salt micelles in foods. In addition, long-term ingestion of this black tea extract (BTE) significantly reduces blood cholesterol levels in rats. We investigated the effects of BTE tablets (a formula designed to enhance compliance) as a dietary supplement in a 3-month double-blind randomized group comparison study in borderline hypercholesterolemic human subjects (n = 47). All subjects ingested BTE tablets (333 mg) or placebo 3 times daily before meals for 3 months. In the BTE-treated group, the initial mean blood total (6.14 +/- 0.14 mol/L) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (4.32 +/- 0.14 mol/L) levels decreased with time and were significantly (P < .01) lower (total cholesterol, 5.62 +/- 0.11; LDL cholesterol, 3.81 +/- 0.13 mol/L) after 3 months of ingestion. Furthermore, the mean body weights (P < .05) and triacylglycerol levels (P < .01) were also significantly reduced after 3 months of BTE intake compared with the baseline levels. Significant improvements in the mean LDL cholesterol, body weight, and triacylglycerol values were not accompanied with undesirable changes in other biochemical parameters measured in the subjects. None of the subjects complained of any adverse effects (eg, abdominal distension). The results indicate that BTE intake elicited a significant antihypercholesterolemic effect and might be useful for improving blood cholesterol levels in subjects at risk for heart disease or obesity.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe added on to atorvastatin (40 mg) compared with uptitration of atorvastatin (to 80 mg) in hypercholesterolemic patients at high risk of coronary heart disease.
AB  - The percentage of change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol after the addition of ezetimibe 10 mg to atorvastatin 40 mg was compared with uptitration to atorvastatin 80 mg. In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study, adult hypercholesterolemic patients using atorvastatin 40 mg/day were randomly assigned to atorvastatin 40 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg or uptitration to atorvastatin 80 mg. After 6 weeks of treatment, compared with atorvastatin 80 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg plus ezetimibe significantly reduced the primary end point of LDL cholesterol by -27% versus atorvastatin 80 mg by -11% (p <0.001), as well as significantly reduced non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and triglycerides significantly more than atorvastatin 80 mg (all p <0.001). Percentages of change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I were similar between groups. Significantly more patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg plus ezetimibe reached LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl versus patients treated with atorvastatin 80 mg (74% vs 32%; p <0.001). Safety and tolerability profiles and incidence of liver and muscle adverse experiences were generally similar between groups. In conclusion, these results showed that adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin 40 mg was significantly more effective than uptitrating to atorvastatin 80 mg at lowering LDL cholesterol and other lipid parameters. Both treatments were generally well tolerated (clinical trial no. NCT00276484).

TI  - Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe added on to atorvastatin (20 mg) versus uptitration of atorvastatin (to 40 mg) in hypercholesterolemic patients at moderately high risk for coronary heart disease.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe 10 mg added to atorvastatin 20 mg compared with doubling atorvastatin to 40 mg in patients with hypercholesterolemia at moderately high risk for coronary heart disease who did not reach low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels <100 mg/dl with atorvastatin 20 mg. In this 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study, 196 patients treated with atorvastatin 20 mg received atorvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg for 6 weeks. Adding ezetimibe 10 mg to atorvastatin 20 mg produced significantly greater reductions in LDL cholesterol than increasing atorvastatin to 40 mg (-31% vs -11%, p <0.001). Significantly greater reductions were also seen in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (p <0.001). Significantly more patients reached LDL cholesterol levels <100 mg/dl with atorvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe compared with atorvastatin 40 mg (84% vs 49%, p <0.001). The 2 treatment groups had comparable results for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A-I, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The incidences of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences were generally similar between groups. In conclusion, the addition of ezetimibe 10 mg to atorvastatin 20 mg was generally well tolerated and resulted in significantly greater lipid-lowering efficacy compared with doubling atorvastatin to 40 mg in patients with hypercholesterolemia at moderately high risk for coronary heart disease.

TI  - Rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors.
AB  - Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) including protease inhibitors (PIs) has been independently associated with an abnormal lipid profile, and recent studies have shown an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in patients with prolonged exposure to HAART. Aim of our open-label, randomized, prospective study is to evaluate the role of different statins in the management of PI-associated hypercholesterolaemia. Ninety-four adult patients on a stable PI-based antiretroviral therapy since at least 12 months, and presenting hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol level >250 mg/dL) of at least 3-month duration and unresponsive to a hypolipidaemic diet and physical exercise, were randomized to a hypolipidaemic treatment with rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), pravastatin (20 mg once daily) or atorvastatin (10 mg once daily), and were followed-up for 12 months. Among the 85 subjects who completed the study, rosuvastatin was employed in 26 cases, pravastatin in 31, and atorvastatin in 28. At the close of 1-year follow-up, statins led to a mean reduction of 21.2% and 23.6% versus baseline total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, respectively (p=0.002). Mean decrease in total cholesterol concentration was significantly greater with rosuvastatin (25.2%) than with pravastatin (17.6%; p=0.01) and atorvastatin (19.8%; p=0.03). During these 12 months, all administered statins showed a favourable tolerability profile, and patients' plasma HIV viral load did not present any variation. All used statins showed a significant efficacy and a good tolerability in the treatment of diet-resistant hyperlipidaemia, but rosuvastatin was found to be more effective in reducing total and LDL cholesterol levels.

TI  - Effects of long-term plant sterol or stanol ester consumption on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in subjects on statin treatment.
AB  - Consumption of plant sterol- or stanol-enriched margarines by statin users results in an additional LDL-cholesterol reduction of approximately 10 %, which may be larger than the average decrease of 3-7 % achieved by doubling the statin dose. However, whether this effect persists in the long term is not known. Therefore, we examined in patients already on stable statin treatment the effects of 85 weeks of plant sterol and stanol ester consumption on the serum lipoprotein profile, cholesterol metabolism, and bile acid synthesis. For this, a double-blind randomised trial was designed in which fifty-four patients consumed a control margarine with no added plant sterols or stanols for 5 weeks (run-in period). For the next 85 weeks, seventeen subjects continued with the control margarine and the other two groups with either a plant sterol (n 18) or plant stanol (n 19) (2.5 g/d each) ester-enriched margarine. Blood was sampled at the end of the run-in period and every 20 weeks during the intervention period. Compared with the control group, plant sterol and stanol ester consumption reduced LDL-cholesterol by 0.28 mmol/l (or 8.7 %; P = 0.08) and 0.42 mmol/l (13.1 %; P = 0.006) respectively after 85 weeks. No effects were found on plasma concentrations of oxysterols or 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, a bile acid synthesis marker. We conclude that long-term consumption of both plant sterol and stanol esters effectively lowered LDL-cholesterol concentrations in statin users.

TI  - Effects of D-003, a mixture of sugarcane wax acids, on platelet aggregation in hypercholesterolemic patients. A dose-titration, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - Increased platelet aggregation contributes to vascular risk. D-003, a mixture of high molecular weight sugarcane wax acids, has shown antiplatelet effects in experimental models and healthy volunteers. This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study investigated the effects of titrated doses of D-003 (5-20 mg/d) on platelet aggregation in hypercholesterolemic patients. After a 4-week baseline phase, 56 patients were randomised to D-003 5 mg/d or placebo. The doses were doubled every 15 days if arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation was not inhibited at least by 15%. AA (0.75 and 1.5 mmol/L) and collagen (1 microg/mL)-induced platelet aggregation, laboratory and physical safety indicators were assessed at baseline and every 15 days thereafter, when adverse events (AE) were also reported. No significant change of platelet aggregation was found in the placebo group. After 15, 30 and 45 on therapy, D-003 reduced platelet aggregation induced with both AA 0.75 mmol/L (18.1%, 19.0% and 30.3%, respectively) and AA 1.5 mmol/L (17.0%, 16.3% and 22.5%, respectively), and also collagen-induced platelet aggregation (26.6%, 20.8% and 29.4%) (p < 0.01 at days 15 and 30 versus placebo, p < 0.0001 at study completion). The mean inhibition of platelet aggregation with D-003 at day 15, at which all patients had received the lowest dose, was over 15%. Nineteen out of 28 D-003 randomised patients (67.9%) required dose titration to achieve such goal. At trial completion, the mean estimated dose was 11.6 mg/d. D-003 lowered low-density lipoprotein (22.0 %), total cholesterol (14.7%) and raised high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (10.9%) (p < 0.0001 versus placebo). Six patients (2 placebo, 4 D-003) withdrew from the trial, none due to AE. D-003 did not modify the safety indicators with respect to placebo. Four patients (2 placebo, 2 D-003-treated) reported AE: pruritus and increased blood pressure (2 placebo) and rash and polyphagla (2 D-003). In conclusion, D-003 (5-20 mg/d) given as doses titrated every 15 days (5-20 mg/d) inhibited AA- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation in hypercholesterolemic patients and was well tolerated.

TI  - Effect of statins on soluble CD40 ligand in hypercholesterolemic Type 2 diabetic patients.
AB  - Hypercholesterolemia and Type 2 diabetes are well-recognized risk factors for cardiovascular disease, promoted by a condition of subclinical inflammation and a hypercoagulable state. Soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), a marker of vascular inflammation, seems to predict vascular damage in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Beside the lipid-lowering effect, statins seem to slow the progression of atherosclerosis through a series of anti-inflammatory effects, including a reduction of sCD40L levels. This study compared the effect of a short-term (12 weeks) treatment with rosuvastatin or simvastatin on some markers of inflammation in 36 patients with Type 2 diabetes and moderate hypercholesterolemia. As expected, both drugs significantly modified lipid profile; moreover, rosuvastatin and simvastatin were both able to significantly reduce albumin excretion rate in these patients, without affecting urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Serum homocysteine was not influenced by the treatment, as interleukin-6 levels, while C reactive protein diminished; moreover, rosuvastatin, but not simvastatin, was able to significantly reduce sCD40L. The only clinical parameter related with the variations in sCD40L was systolic blood pressure. In hypercholesterolemic Type 2 diabetic patients, sCD40L, a factor playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and associated with more rupture-prone lesions, is reduced by short-term treatment with rosuvastatin.

TI  - Long-term (48-week) safety of ezetimibe 10 mg/day coadministered with simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - During this 48-week extension study, the coadministration of ezetimibe/simvastatin was generally as well tolerated as simvastatin monotherapy. The direct application of study observations to clinical practice is limited by patient selection criteria and dosage regime, which randomly applied relatively high doses rather than titration which often occurs in clinical practice.

TI  - Atorvastatin induces associated reductions in platelet P-selectin, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and interleukin-6 in patients with coronary artery diseases.
AB  - The development and progression of atherosclerosis comprises various processes, such as endothelial dysfunction, chronic inflammation, thrombus formation, and lipid profile modification. Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors that have pleiotropic effects in addition to cholesterol-lowering properties. However, the mechanisms of these effects are not completely understood. Here, we investigated whether atorvastatin affects the levels of malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDALDL), an oxidized LDL, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), or platelet P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation, relative to that of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Forty-eight patients with coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia were separated into two groups that were administered with (atorvastatin group) or without (control group) atorvastatin. The baseline MDA-LDL level in all participants significantly correlated with LDL-C (r = 0.71, P < 0.01) and apolipoprotein B levels (r = 0.66, P < 0.01). Atorvastatin (10 mg/day) significantly reduced the LDL-C level within 4 weeks and persisted for a further 8 weeks of administration. Atorvastatin also reduced the MDA-LDL level within 4 weeks and further reduced it over the next 8 weeks. Platelet P-selectin expression did not change until 4 weeks of administration and then significantly decreased at 12 weeks, whereas the IL-6 level was gradually, but not significantly, reduced at 12 weeks. In contrast, none of these parameters significantly changed in the control group within these time frames. The reduction (%) in IL-6 between 4 and 12 weeks after atorvastatin administration significantly correlated with that of MDALDL and of platelet P-selectin (r = 0.65, P < 0.05 and r = 0.70, P < 0.05, respectively). These results suggested that the positive effects of atorvastatin on the LDL-C oxidation, platelet activation and inflammation that are involved in atherosclerotic processes are exerted in concert after lowering LDL-C.

TI  - A 52-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparison of the tolerability and effects of pitavastatin and atorvastatin on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and glucose metabolism in Japanese patients with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and glucose intolerance.
AB  - In these patients with elevated LDL-C levels and glucose intolerance, 52 weeks of treatment with pitavastatin 2 mg/d was associated with significantly greater increases in HDL-C and Apo A-I levels than atorvastatin 10 mg/d. Both treatments were well tolerated.

TI  - Combination of simvastatin with berberine improves the lipid-lowering efficacy.
AB  - We have identified berberine (BBR) as a novel cholesterol-lowering drug acting through stabilization of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) messenger RNA. Because the mechanism differs from that of statins, it is of great interest to examine the lipid-lowering activity of BBR in combination with statins. Our results showed that combination of BBR with simvastatin (SIMVA) increased the LDLR gene expression to a level significantly higher than that in monotherapies. In the treatment of food-induced hyperlipidemic rats, combination of BBR (90 mg/[kg d], oral) with SIMVA (6 mg/[kg d], oral) reduced serum LDL cholesterol by 46.2%, which was more effective than that of the SIMVA (28.3%) or BBR (26.8%) monotherapy (P < .01 for both) and similar to that of SIMVA at 12 mg/(kg d) (43.4%). More effective reduction of serum triglyceride was also achieved with the combination as compared with either monotherapy. Combination of BBR with SIMVA up-regulated the LDLR messenger RNA in rat livers to a level about 1.6-fold higher than the monotherapies did. Significant reduction of liver fat storage and improved liver histology were found after the combination therapy. The therapeutic efficacy of the combination was then evaluated in 63 hypercholesterolemic patients. As compared with monotherapies, the combination showed an improved lipid-lowering effect with 31.8% reduction of serum LDL cholesterol (P < .05 vs BBR alone, P < .01 vs SIMVA alone). Similar efficacies were observed in the reduction of total cholesterol as well as triglyceride in the patients. Our results display the rationale, effectiveness, and safety of the combination therapy for hyperlipidemia using BBR and SIMVA. It could be a new regimen for hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Short term fluvastatin treatment lowers serum asymmetric dimethylarginine levels in patients with metabolic syndrome.
AB  - Elevated concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, are associated with endothelial dysfunction. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is also a condition associated with impaired endothelial function. To test the hypothesis that lipid lowering treatment with a statin lowers ADMA levels, we investigated the effect of fluvastatin treatment on serum ADMA levels in patients with MetS. A total of 85 hypercholesterolemic MetS patients (53 females, 32 males; mean age, 55.8+/-9.1 years) were included in this prospective, randomized, controlled study. Patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment (n=42) or control group (n=43). Recommendations for lifestyle modification were provided to both groups. In addition, the patients in the treatment group received fluvastatin, extended release tablets, 80 mg/day, orally for 6 weeks. Serum levels of ADMA and lipids were assessed at baseline and at the completion of treatment. High performance liquid chromatography was used to measure serum ADMA concentrations. In the fluvastatin group, there was a significant reduction in serum ADMA levels compared to baseline (from 1.57+/-1.07 micromol/L to 1.17+/-1.41 micromol/L, P<0.05), whereas in the control group no significant change was observed (from 1.06+/-0.46 micromol/L to 1.24+/-1.38 micromol/L, P>0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of mean percent change from baseline (P=0.047). Fluvastatin treatment for hypercholesterolemia in patients with MetS is associated with a decrease in serum ADMA levels at 6 weeks. This finding is consistent with known beneficial effects of statin treatment on endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients.

TI  - Simvastatin reduces endothelial activation and damage but is partially ineffective in inducing endothelial repair in systemic sclerosis.
AB  - Treatment with simvastatin results in rapid and significant improvement of measures of endothelial activation, suggesting a potential role of statins in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease in SSc. The lack of effect on increase of EPC confirms our previous findings of a defective endothelial stem cell recruitment in the bone marrow of SSc patients. This could indicate that the potential effectiveness of statins in SSc could mainly be ascribed to their effectiveness in modulating endothelial activation mechanisms.

TI  - Effect of calcium lactate supplementation on cholesterol concentration in patients with hyperlipidaemia and previous viral hepatitis: a preliminary report.
AB  - The aim of the study was to estimate the effect of calcium supplementation on cholesterol concentrations in patients with hyperlipidaemia and previous viral hepatitis. The study comprised 43 patients, aged 28 to 82 years (21 with type 2 hyperlipidaemia). The control group included 22 healthy subjects. After four weeks of a hypolipaemic diet (wash-out period), the patients with type 2 hyperlipidaemia were recruited to a group administered a complex preparation containing 170 mg of calcium lactate and 60 mg of vitamin C (Calcium C, Polfa-Lodz SA, Poland) at a dose of one tablet three times a day. After four weeks of active therapy, the concentration of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) decreased by 4, 6 and 8%, respectively. Statistical significance was obtained for only TC (p = 0.03) when comparing the group of patients with hypercholesterolaemia before and after the therapy with the calcium preparation. A statistically insignificant increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of 1% was observed. Within the four-week period of calcium supplementation at a dose of 510 mg/24 h, the total concentration of calcium decreased by 3%, whereas the concentration of ionised calcium increased by 7%. None of the obtained values was of statistical significance. In patients with type 2 hyperlipidaemia and previous viral hepatitis, a four-week supplementation of calcium in a calcium lactate preparation beneficially modified the lipid profile. I t statistically significantly decreased the total cholesterol concentration by 4% (p = 0.03), did not cause any significant changes in serum calcium concentration, was well tolerated and did not induce any side effects.

TI  - Sugar cane policosanol failed to lower plasma cholesterol in primitive, diet-resistant hypercholesterolaemia: a double blind, controlled study.
AB  - Previous clinical studies have shown that oral administration of sugar cane policosanol (SCP) reduces plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial was performed in hypercholesterolaemic, diet-resistant patients. Seventy patients meeting the selection criteria were enrolled. Each subject was treated with policosanol 10 mg/d in addition to a dietetic regimen for 8 weeks. At the start and at the end of the study body weight, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) plasma levels were measured. Thirty-three subjects in the policosanol and Thirty-one subjects in the control group completed the study. During the study body mass index, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides plasma levels did not change significantly within and between groups. In conclusion, sugar cane policosanol at a dose of 10mg/d showed no lipid lowering effects in subjects with primitive, diet-resistant hypercholesterolaemia.

TI  - Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia: effects of drug treatment on fatty acid composition of plasma lipids and membranes.
AB  - The effect of atorvastatin, simvastatin and gemfibrozil on fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids (PL), cholesterol esters (CE), triglycerides (TG) and red cell membrane ghosts (G) has been determined in appropriate sample populations of individuals with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) or hypercholesterolemia (HCHL). Treatments were appropriate for the condition, gemfibrozil for HTG and a statin for HCHL. Modifications depend on the drug and lipid fraction examined. Both classes of drugs modify fatty acid composition but gemfibrozil modifications are more numerous and dramatic than are the modifications by statins. Gemfibrozil produces major modifications in fatty acid composition, which are both fatty acid and lipid class specific but generally decreases SFA and increases PUFA (mainly n6) and increases the proportion of fatty acids with chain length of 18C or more. Statins tend to increase chain length but have less effect on saturation. Notably, all three drugs increased arachidonic acid (AA) in PL and CE. Statins decreased gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) in PL and CE but gemfibrozil only increased GLA in TG.

TI  - Ezetimibe effectively lowers LDL-cholesterol in cardiac allograft recipients on stable statin therapy.
AB  - We investigated tolerability and efficacy of ezetimibe treatment (10 mg/d) in 25 heart allograft recipients already on stable statin therapy. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), immunosuppressant drug levels, laboratory and clinical parameters were assessed before, four months and one yr after initiation of ezetimibe treatment. Mean equivalent statin dose was 53.5 +/- 12.3 mg of pravastatin, remaining unchanged throughout the study period. Ezetimibe was generally well tolerated, only two patients (8%) discontinued ezetimibe due to stomach pain or headache. Mean TC decreased from 231.8 +/- 6.4 mg/dL before therapy to 202.2 +/- 8.8 mg/dL after four months and 192.9 +/- 7.0 mg/dL after one yr (p < 0.001). Mean LDL-C decreased from 143.1 +/- 5.4 mg/dL to 121.4 +/- 7.9 mg/dL (month 4; p < 0.05) and 107.1 +/- 5.6 mg/dL (one yr; p < 0.001). TG decreased from 182 +/- 14.3 mg/dL to 173.3 +/- 17.5 mg/dL after one yr (p < 0.05), whereas HDL-C was unchanged. Initial LDL-C and cardiac diagnosis before transplantation were identified as predictors of absolute LDL-C reduction. Immunosuppressant drug doses and blood concentrations were unchanged as well as other laboratory and clinical parameters. Ezetimibe appears safe and effective for further reduction of TC and LDL-C in heart allograft recipients already on stable statin therapy. Extent of pre-treatment LDL-C and cardiac disorder prior to transplantation appear to correlate with the efficacy of ezetimibe therapy.

TI  - Comparison of the safety and efficacy of a combination tablet of niacin extended release and simvastatin vs simvastatin monotherapy in patients with increased non-HDL cholesterol (from the SEACOAST I study).
AB  - The efficacy and safety of 2 regimens of a combination of a proprietary niacin extended release plus simvastatin (NER/S; 1,000/20 and 2,000/20 mg/day) were compared with simvastatin monotherapy (20 mg/day) for 24 weeks in 319 high-risk patients with predominantly mixed dyslipidemia who were already at National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III risk-adjusted goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After a run-in on simvastatin 20 mg/day, both NER/S doses (1,000/20 and 2,000/20 mg/day) resulted in greater decreases in non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol vs simvastatin 20 mg/day (-13.9% and -22.5% vs -7.4%, respectively; p <0.01). Significant improvements in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), and total/HDL cholesterol ratio were also observed. Patients with hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides > or =200 mg/dl) typically had greater lipid responses to NER/S with the notable exception that HDL cholesterol responses to NER/S were similar in those with or without increased triglycerides. Treatment with both doses of NER/S was well tolerated; < or =60% of patients in any treatment group experienced flushing, >90% of flushing was mild or moderate in intensity, and only 7.5% of patients in both NER/S treatment groups discontinued because of flushing. The safety of NER/S was consistent with the safety profile of each individual component. In conclusion, this study showed that NER/S provided additional clinically relevant improvements in multiple lipid parameters and was safe and well tolerated.

TI  - The benefits of intensive lipid lowering in patients with stable coronary heart disease with normal or high systolic blood pressure: an analysis of the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study.
AB  - This post-hoc analysis of the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study evaluated the joint effects of managing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) on cardiovascular outcomes. Patients (N=9739) with clinically evident, stable coronary heart disease (CHD) were randomized to atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg/d. The primary end point was occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event. At 3 months' follow-up, patients were stratified according to SBP (< 140 mm Hg vs > or = 140 mm Hg) and tertiles of LDL-C. At 4.9 years' median follow-up, the rate of major cardiovascular events was reduced most in patients with lower LDL-C (P < .001) and in patients with SBP < 140 mm Hg (P = .014). A 42% relative risk reduction was observed for patients in the lowest LDL-C tertile with an SBP < 140 mm Hg, compared with patients in the highest LDL-C tertile with an SBP > or = 140 mm Hg. The effect of lower SBP on stroke was most pronounced in the lowest LDL-C tertile.

TI  - Effects of atorvastatin and pravastatin on glucose tolerance, adipokine levels and inflammatory markers in hypercholesterolaemic patients.
AB  - Several randomized clinical trials have suggested that atorvastatin and pravastatin may differ in terms of their pleiotropic effects. To verify this, we compared the effects of both statins on glucose tolerance, adipokine concentrations and inflammatory markers. A total of 36 hypercholesterolaemic patients without known coronary heart disease (CHD) were enrolled in an open-label, randomized, crossover study. The patients received pravastatin or atorvastatin (10 mg/day) for 4 months and then switched to the other statin for an additional 4 months. At the end of both treatment periods, atorvastatin significantly reduced the concentration of serum lipids (total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides) and inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor-a) and increased serum adiponectin levels compared with pravastatin treatment. Although these effects would be expected to improve insulin sensitivity, atorvastatin did not affect glucose tolerance, which was assessed by fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, the homeostasis model assessment index and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels. Only obese patients showed increased HbA(1c) levels after atorvastatin treatment. Our results suggest that atorvastatin has both advantages and disadvantages compared with pravastatin treatment. Further studies are required to compare the relative clinical value of atorvastatin and pravastatin, especially in obese patients without CHD.

TI  - Artichoke leaf extract (Cynara scolymus) reduces plasma cholesterol in otherwise healthy hypercholesterolemic adults: a randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial.
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the chief causes of death in the UK, and are associated with high circulating levels of total cholesterol in the plasma. Artichoke leaf extracts (ALEs) have been reported to reduce plasma lipids levels, including total cholesterol, although high quality data is lacking. The objective of this trial was to assess the effect of ALE on plasma lipid levels and general well-being in otherwise healthy adults with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. 131 adults were screened for total plasma cholesterol in the range 6.0-8.0 mmol/l, with 75 suitable volunteers randomised onto the trial. Volunteers consumed 1280 mg of a standardised ALE, or matched placebo, daily for 12 weeks. Plasma total cholesterol decreased in the treatment group by an average of 4.2% (from 7.16 (SD 0.62) mmol/l to 6.86 (SD 0.68) mmol/l) and increased in the control group by an average of 1.9% (6.90 (SD 0.49) mmol/l to 7.03 (0.61) mmol/l), the difference between groups being statistically significant (p=0.025). No significant differences between groups were observed for LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels. General well-being improved significantly in both the treatment (11%) and control groups (9%) with no significant differences between groups. In conclusion, ALE consumption resulted in a modest but favourable statistically significant difference in total cholesterol after 12 weeks. In comparison with a previous trial, it is suggested that the apparent positive health status of the study population may have contributed to the modesty of the observed response.

TI  - Reduction of charge-modified LDL by statin therapy in patients with CHD or CHD risk factors and elevated LDL-C levels: the SPECIAL Study.
AB  - Various forms of atherogenic modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) including oxidized LDL and small, dense LDL have increased negative charge as compared to normal LDL. Charge-modified LDL (electronegative LDL) and normal LDL subfractions in plasma are analyzed by capillary isotachophoresis (cITP) as fast-migrating LDL (fLDL) and slow-migrating LDL (sLDL). We examined the effects of pravastatin and simvastatin on charge-based LDL subfractions as determined by cITP in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Patients (n=72) with CHD or CHD risk factors and elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were randomly assigned to receive pravastatin or simvastatin. After treatment with statins for 3 and 6 months, both cITP fLDL and sLDL were reduced (p<0.05) from the baseline, but the effects did not differ between treatment with pravastatin and simvastatin. At baseline and after treatment for 3 months, cITP sLDL was correlated with LDL-C, but fLDL was correlated with inflammatory markers, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and LDL-associated platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, and atherogenic lipoproteins, remnant-like particle cholesterol and small, dense LDL cholesterol. In conclusion, cITP fLDL was related to inflammatory markers and atherogenic lipoproteins and was reduced by treatment with statins. Charge-modified LDL subfraction could be a potential marker for atherosclerosis and a target for therapy.

AB  - Our aim in this study was to investigate the changes of serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and uric acid (UA), and evaluate the synergistic effect of amlodipine and atorvastatin on blood pressure and left ventricular remodeling in hypertensive patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. One hundred and twenty-six hypertensive patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomized into amlodipine group (10 mg/day, group A, n = 65) and amlodipine (10 mg/day) plus atorvastatin group (20 mg/day, group B, n = 61), treated for 4 months continuously. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, hs-CRP, and UA were determined, and blood pressure of both groups was examined before and after treatment. Left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular spectum thickness were measured by echocardiography, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was calculated. After 4-months of treatment with atorvastatin, serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, hs-CRP, and UA were significantly decreased in group B (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), while serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was elevated (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were reduced in both groups (P < 0.05), and blood pressure in group B was markedly lower than that in group A after treatment (P < 0.05). Compared with that before treatment, LVMI in both groups decreased (P < 0.05), to a significantly lower degree in group B than in group A (P < 0.05). Atorvastatin can decrease serum concentrations of hs-CRP and UA. The amlodipine-atorvastatin combination markedly reduces blood pressure and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy more than amlodipine monotherapy. The positive effect suggests that in hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic patients, the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin could be the treatment of choice.

TI  - Effect of APOE genotype on lipid levels in patients with coronary heart disease during a 3-week inpatient rehabilitation program.
AB  - It has been suggested that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modifies the effect of dietary and pharmacological interventions for lowering lipid levels. We wanted to determine whether APOE genotyping information would be useful in making lipid-lowering treatment decisions in clinical practice. We included 981 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) enrolled in an inpatient 3-week standardized rehabilitation program. Of these, 555 (57%) patients received continued statin therapy and 232 (24%) patients received newly initiated statin therapy. Dietary intervention was part of the program only for 194 (20%) patients. Total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) levels decreased in all the groups of patients during rehabilitation. The decreases were less pronounced among the APOE E2 carriers. However, the observed variation among the groups with respect to reduction of lipid levels was accounted for mainly by the initial lipid levels (30-47%) and only marginally on the APOE genotype (1%) . We therefore found no evidence that APOE genotyping will be useful in guiding dietary or pharmacological lipid-lowering treatment decisions.

TI  - Statin therapy increases carotid plaque echogenicity in hypercholesterolemic patients.
AB  - Stabilization of carotid artery plaques by pharmacologic intervention is a promising strategy for the prevention of ischemic stroke. In this study, we examined the effect of 12 months of statin therapy on carotid plaque echogenicity. This study included 81 hypercholesterolemic patients with carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Echogenicity of the largest plaque in each patient was evaluated by ultrasound with integrated backscatter analysis. All patients underwent dietary modification. Forty patients were treated with simvastatin (10 mg/day, n = 24) or atorvastatin (5 mg/day, n = 16) according to the choice by each attending physician. Carotid plaques were monitored by measuring plaque thickness and echogenicity during a 12-month follow-up period. Levels of serum high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-18 were determined in all patients. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, hs-CRP and IL-18 were significantly decreased after 12 months of statin therapy. The change in IL-6 level was not significant. Significant increases in echogenicity of carotid plaques and decreases in plaque thickness were noted after statin therapy. In the 41 patients without statin therapy, carotid plaque echogenicity, plaque thickness and serum levels of inflammatory markers were not significantly altered. Our results suggest that statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients for 12 months increases carotid plaque echogenicity and decreases plaque thickness, in addition to lowering serum levels of lipids and inflammatory markers.

TI  - Effect of pretreatment with statins on ischemic stroke outcomes.
AB  - Pretreatment with statins was associated with better stroke outcomes in whites, but we found no evidence of a beneficial effect of statins in blacks. These findings indicate the need for further studies, including randomized trials, to examine differential effects of statins on ischemic stroke outcomes among whites and blacks.

TI  - Impact of statin therapy on left ventricular function and carotid arterial stiffness in patients with hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - One year of pitavastatin treatment improved not only carotid arterial stiffness but also regional LV systolic and diastolic function in patients with hypercholesterolemia and preserved LVEF. Ultrasonic strain imaging has the potential to become a sensitive tool for detecting the effects of early medical intervention on latent regional LV myocardial dysfunction in this patient population.

TI  - Effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation with pioglitazone on plasma adipokines in nondiabetic patients with either hypercholesterolemia or hypertension.
AB  - Adipokines are substances produced by the adipose tissue that may play significant roles in the mechanisms contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. Thiazolidinediones have been shown to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation and to exert multiple antiatherosclerotic effects. This study tested the hypotheses that nondiabetic patients with cardiovascular risk factors have altered levels of adipokines that can be modified by pioglitazone treatment. Eighty patients with hypertension or hypercholesterolemia were in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study. In each treatment phase, patients received pioglitazone 45 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks. Endothelial function studies and biochemical assays were performed at the end of each 8-week treatment period. Twenty-two normal volunteers, matched with patients for age, gender, and body mass index, were recruited as a control group. Compared with controls, placebo-treated patients had lower adiponectin levels (11,160 +/- 763 vs 6,078 +/- 385 ng/ml, p <0.001) and similar plasma leptin levels (21.5 +/- 3.8 vs 16.2 +/- 1.5 ng/ml, p = 0.128) and resistin levels (5.1 +/- 0.4 vs 4.4 +/- 0.2 ng/ml, p = 0.250). In patients, pioglitazone treatment markedly increased adiponectin (+121%, p <0.001) and decreased resistin (-10.5%, p = 0.03). Leptin was not significantly decreased (-7.1%, p = 0.10). In multivariate analysis, pioglitazone-induced changes in endothelial reactivity to acetylcholine were the only significant predictor of increases in adiponectin. In conclusion, in nondiabetic patients with major cardiovascular risk factors, pioglitazone treatment beneficially influences circulating adipokine levels. The relation between the increase in adiponectin levels and the improvement in endothelial vasodilator activity suggests a mechanistic link between vascular effects and adiponectinemia.

TI  - The impact of ezetimibe and high-dose of statin treatment on LDL levels in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - We evaluated the efficacy and the safety of combining high doses of statins and ezetimibe in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hFH) patients. Seventy patients with hFH, received 10 mg of ezetimibe, in addition to their current statin therapy and were followed up for twelve months. The co-administration of statins and ezetimibe improved total cholesterol (p<0.05), LDL-c(p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and apolipoprotein-B (p<0.05) in comparison to statin monotherapy. There were no changes in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), apolipoprotein-A, lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CPR). In conclusion the combination of 10 mg of ezetimibe with high dose statin therapy is effective in hFH, offering a further reduction of LDL-c throughout the 12 months of follow up.

TI  - Effects of fluvastatin extended-release (80 mg) alone and in combination with ezetimibe (10 mg) on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and inflammatory parameters in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia: a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study.
AB  - Fluvastatin XL in combination with ezetimibe was found to be well-tolerated and effective, allowing the majority (87%) of these patients with primary hypercholesterolemia to achieve current treatment goals, and reduced hs-CRP levels in patients at higher cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Effectiveness of ezetimibe alone or in combination with twice a week Atorvastatin (10 mg) for statin intolerant high-risk patients.
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of ezetimibe (10 mg/day) alone or in combination with atorvastatin (10 mg twice a week) on hypercholesterolemia in 56 high-risk patients intolerant to daily statin use. Ezetimibe monotherapy was well tolerated (2 withdrawals) and induced a mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 20% (p <0.05) at the third month. However, of the 54 patients still taking ezetimibe, only 5 (9%) were at their LDL cholesterol targets. Atorvastatin 10 mg twice a week was then added to ezetimibe and was well tolerated (3 withdrawals). This combination reduced LDL cholesterol (in a treatment-based analysis) by 37% compared with baseline (p <0.001), with 43 (84%) patients reaching their LDL cholesterol goals. When patients (n = 34, 25 men) with baseline serum creatinine values in the upper 2 tertiles were analyzed separately, there was a significant (p = 0.041) decrease in serum creatinine levels after 6 months of treatment. In conclusion, the combination of ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 10 mg twice a week might be a therapeutic option for high-risk patients intolerant to daily statin monotherapy.

TI  - Effect of rosuvastatin therapy on carotid plaque morphology and composition in moderately hypercholesterolemic patients: a high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging trial.
AB  - In patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia, both low- and high-dose rosuvastatin were effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore, rosuvastatin was associated with a reduction in %LRNC, whereas the overall plaque burden remained unchanged over the course of 2 years of treatment. These findings provide evidence that statin therapy may have a beneficial effect on plaque volume and composition, as assessed by noninvasive MRI.

TI  - Safety assessment of common foods enriched with natural nonesterified plant sterols.
AB  - Fifteen-week consumption of natural nonesterified plant sterol-enriched food does not cause any serious adverse effects during such a period. However, serum alpha-tocopherol levels were somewhat reduced in the sterol group suggesting that long-term effects of plant sterols on serum fat-soluble vitamin concentrations should be further explored, especially in relation to very low-fat diets.

UI  - 18249205
TI  - Efficacy of plant sterols is not influenced by dietary cholesterol intake in hypercholesterolemic individuals.
AB  - Plant sterols (PSs) reduce plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by reducing cholesterol absorption; however, it is not known whether the level of dietary cholesterol intake has an impact on the efficacy of PSs on blood lipids. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of high vs low dietary cholesterol levels on the lipid-lowering efficacy of free PSs. The study was a semirandomized, double-blind, crossover trial consisting of four 28-day feeding phases each separated by a 4-week washout period. Otherwise healthy hypercholesterolemic subjects (n = 22) consumed each of (a) low-cholesterol control (C(-)S(-)), (b) high-cholesterol control (C(+)S(-)), (c) 22 mg PSs per kilogram of body weight with a low-cholesterol diet (C(-)S(+)), and (d) 22 mg PSs per kilogram of body weight with a high-cholesterol diet (C(+)S(+)). Blood was drawn on the first and last 2 days of each phase to measure plasma total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triacylglycerols as well as plasma campesterol and beta-sitosterol concentrations. Dietary cholesterol had no effect on PS efficacy as a cholesterol-lowering agent because no interaction was found between the 2 factors. However, dietary cholesterol and PS intake had significant independent effects on plasma total cholesterol, LDL-C, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. beta-Sitosterol levels in plasma increased (P < .0001) as a result of PS supplementation. Data from the present study indicate that, although PSs and dietary cholesterol exert independent effects on plasma cholesterol, PS efficacy is not affected by varying levels of cholesterol intake.

TI  - Rice policosanol does not have any effects on blood coagulation factors in hypercholesterolemic patients.
AB  - Policosanol is an agent that includes mixtures of aliphatic primary alcohols extracted primarily from sugercane wax. Policosanol has been shown to lower total and LDL cholesterol in animal models, healthy volunteers and hypercholesterolemic patients. However, these findings have been challanged recently. Up to now, there has been no study investigating the effects ofpolicosanol on blood coagulation factors. This study investigated the effects of rice policosanol (Oryza sp.) 10 mg/day on blood coagulation factors in 66 hypercholesterolemic patients of both sexes aged 20 to 78 years in a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. After an 8-week run-in period in which patients were placed on therapeutic lifestyle changes, in particular a cholesterol-lowering diet, they were randomly assigned to receive rice policosanol 10 mg tablets or placebo tablets once daily with the evening meal for 8 weeks. During next 8 weeks those receiving policosanol during the first 8 weeks, received placebo and those taking placebo during the first 8 weeks, received policosanol. Plasma fibrinogen, factors VII, VIII, XII and XIII were measured before and after the treatment. Rice policosanol treatment did not change significantly neither fibrinogen nor factors VII, VIII, XII and XIII.

TI  - A randomised study comparing the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin with atorvastatin for achieving lipid goals in clinical practice in Asian patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (DISCOVERY-Asia study).
AB  - This 12-week study showed that the starting dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg o.d. was significantly more effective than the starting dose of natorvastatin 10 mg o.d. at enabling patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia to achieve European goals for LDL-C and TC in a largely Asian population in real-life clinical practice. The safety profile of rosuvastatin 10 mg is similar to that of atorvastatin 10 mg in the Asian population studied here, and is consistent with the known safety profile of rosuvastatin in the white population.

TI  - Effect of sugar cane policosanol on lipid profile in primary hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - Policosanol, a mixture of long-chain aliphatic primary alcohols, is used as a cholesterol-lowering supplement. The effectiveness of policosanol is still questionable. To determine the lipoprotein-lowering effects of Cuban sugar cane-derived policosanol a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial was performed. Sixty-eight primary hypercholesterolemic subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to the treatment or to the control group. The first group received sugar cane policosanol 20 mg daily for 8 weeks, while the control group was treated with placebo. All subjects followed a normocaloric diet. The content of policosanol in the supplement tablets was assessed by gas chromatography. A total of 32 subjects in the policosanol group and 31 subjects in the control group completed the study. Body mass index, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels did not change significantly in either group. In conclusion, sugar cane policosanol at doses of 20 mg daily showed no lipid lowering effects in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Achieving lipid goals with rosuvastatin compared with simvastatin in high risk patients in real clinical practice: a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multi-center study: the DISCOVERY-Beta study.
AB  - The aim of this multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial was to compare the efficacy of rosuvastatin with that of simvastatin in achieving the 1998 European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) lipid treatment goals. 504 patients (> or =18 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia and a 10-year cardiovascular (CV) risk >20% or history of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other established atherosclerotic disease were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg or simvastatin 20 mg once daily for 12 weeks. A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved 1998 EAS low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal after 12 weeks of treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg compared to simvastatin 20 mg (64 vs 51.5%, p < 0.01). Similarly, significantly more patients achieved the 1998 EAS total cholesterol (TC) goal and the 2003 EAS LDL-C and TC goals (p < 0.001) with rosuvastatin 10 mg compared with simvastatin 20 mg. The incidence of adverse events and the proportion of patients who discontinued study treatment were similar between treatment groups. In conclusion, in the DISCOVERY-Beta Study in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia greater proportion of patients in the rosuvastatin 10 mg group achieved the EAS LDL-C treatment goal compared with the simvastatin 20 mg group. Drug tolerability was similar across both treatment groups.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of pitavastatin and atorvastatin: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label, dose-titration study in Korean patients with hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - In these adult Korean patients with hypercholesterolemia, pitavastatin and atorvastatin did not differ significantly in terms of the proportions of patients achieving the LDL-C goal; reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides; or increases in HDL-C. Both drugs were well tolerated.

TI  - Effect of high beta-glucan barley on serum cholesterol concentrations and visceral fat area in Japanese men--a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - This study investigated whether the consumption of a diet in which high-beta-glucan barley replaced rice would reduce the visceral fat area as well as the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) in hypercholesterolemic Japanese men. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention study was conducted in 44 hypercholesterolemic Japanese men with a body mass index (BMI) >22 kg/m2. The subjects were randomly assigned to groups consuming either rice (placebo group) or a mixture of rice and pearl barley with a high beta-glucan content (test group, 7.0 g beta-glucan per day) for 12 weeks. Blood samples were taken, and CT scan obtained before the trial and every four weeks during the trial. The pearl barley intake significantly reduced serum concentrations of LDL-C (P = 0.041) and TC (P = 0.037) during the trial. Significant differences between the test and placebo groups were found for the visceral fat (P = 0.039), BMI (P = 0.015), and waist circumference (P = 0.011) at the end point. The consumption of pearl barley with a high beta-glucan content reduces not only LDL-C but also visceral fat area.

TI  - SREBP-1c gene polymorphism is associated with increased inhibition of cholesterol-absorption in response to ezetimibe treatment.
AB  - The G/C (G952G) polymorphism of the SREBP-1 gene is not associated with cholesterol synthesis or absorption in a German male population. The CC homozygotes have a significantly increased response to the effects of ezetimibe on cholesterol absorption compared to the G allele-carriers, suggesting that SREBP-1 may be implicated in ezetimibe's mechanism of action.

TI  - Effects of ezetimibe, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe-statin therapies on non-cholesterol sterols in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - The observed effects of co-administration of ezetimibe and statins on non-cholesterol sterols are consistent with net inhibition of sterol absorption (driven by ezetimibe) in conjunction with net inhibition of cholesterol synthesis (driven by statins). The potential influence of treatment-induced changes in phytosterols on cardiovascular risk warrants further investigation in long-term, prospective, randomized controlled trials. This post-hoc study was by nature exploratory, and, because data from such analyses are not customarily adjusted for multiple comparisons, some associations may have emerged as statistically significant by chance. Future prospective randomized controlled studies may help to confirm our findings and address other research issues, such as the generalizability of our findings to patients with CHD or diabetes mellitus and possible dose:response relationships between escalating statin (or ezetimibe-statin) doses and circulating non-cholesterol levels.

TI  - A multicentre, open-label, observational local study to evaluate the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effect of ezetimibe as prescribed in daily routine practice in the South African population.
AB  - Ezetimibe co-administered with ongoing statin therapy consistently produced significant additional improvements in LDL-C levels and goal attainment. This was observed for the whole population as well as for the two risk categories. The addition of ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy may be considered for patients not achieving their LDL-C goals on conventional statin therapy.

TI  - Fish-oil esters of plant sterols differ from vegetable-oil sterol esters in triglycerides lowering, carotenoid bioavailability and impact on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) concentrations in hypercholesterolemic subjects.
AB  - Our findings suggest that, in hypercholesterolemic subjects consuming an OO-based diet, PS-FO results in lowered blood triglyceride and PAI-1 concentrations, and higher fat-soluble vitamin levels in comparison to the vegetable oil FA esters of PS (PS-SO and PS-OO). Thus, PS-FO may offer hyperlipidemic subjects a more comprehensive lipid lowering approach while reducing the potential risk of decreased plasma carotenoid concentrations.

TI  - Effects of vitamin E on cholesterol levels of hypercholesterolemic patients receiving statins.
AB  - Vitamin E supplementation did not affect total or low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic patients receiving lovastatin or simvastatin. A small but significant decrease in HDL cholesterol levels was observed in the group that received vitamin E supplementation during the supplementation period, but this decrease was no longer significantly different from the placebo group's levels two weeks postsupplementation. The decrease in HDL cholesterol levels did not appear to be related to either CYP3A or CETP.

TI  - Serum from hypercholesterolemic patients treated with atorvastatin or simvastatin inhibits cultured human smooth muscle cell proliferation.
AB  - We evaluated the pharmacological activity of whole-blood serum from atorvastatin- vs. simvastatin- (both 40 mg/day) treated hypercholesterolemic patients (n=10) on cultured smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and cholesterol biosynthesis, as related to lipid-lowering effect. Patients received either single or 2-weeks repeated doses of both simvastatin and atorvastatin, following a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design. Blood samples were collected before drug administration and at the scheduled intervals after administration, and the obtained serum was separated by centrifugation, sterilized and frozen until assayed. Cultured SMC were supplemented with medium plus 15% of separate serum sampled from the patients, and grown for 72 h. Proliferation was assayed by a Coulter Counter, while cholesterol biosynthesis was measured by the incorporation of 14C-acetate into cholesterol, under the same experimental conditions. Atorvastatin was more active vs. simvastatin in reducing total- (-28.3% vs. -20.7%; p=0.045) and LDL-cholesterol (-39.8% vs. -30.1%; p=0.011) after a 2-weeks regimen. Serum from atorvastatin-treated patients inhibited SMC proliferation vs.t=0 after both single (AUC -21.6%) and repeated (AUC -26.9%) doses, while serum from simvastatin-treated patients inhibited SMC proliferation only after repeated doses (AUC -24.5%). Interestingly, in the same experimental conditions, the serum concentrations of both statins (and of their active metabolites) were constantly below the detection limits, as shown from the lack of inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. The absence of any significant association between the lipid-lowering effects and the inhibition of SMC proliferation, together with no detectable active statin in the serum, suggests that these effects are elicited through independent mechanisms.

TI  - Long-term efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin 40 mg in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia.
AB  - Patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesteral levels are at high risk of cardiovascular events but are often undertreated and fail to achieve lipid goals. This open-label, noncomparative, multicenter study assessed efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin 40 mg for < or =96 weeks in 1,380 patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Patients > or =18 years old with fasting LDL cholesterol > or =190 and < or =260 mg/dl and triglycerides <400 mg/dl entered a 6-week dietary lead-in, before receiving rosuvastatin 40 mg for 48 weeks. An optional additional 48-week treatment period followed. The initial period had 2 primary end points: percentage of patients achieving National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III LDL cholesterol goals at 12 weeks, and long-term safety, assessed during 48 weeks by incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and abnormal laboratory values. Safety was the primary end point in the extension period. At 12 weeks, 83% of patients achieved NCEP ATP III LDL cholesterol goals, which were maintained during 48 and 96 weeks (81% and 84%, respectively). At 48 weeks, rosuvastatin 40 mg reduced LDL cholesterol from baseline by 52% and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 11% (both p <0.0001). At 96 weeks, LDL cholesterol was reduced by 54% and HDL cholesterol increased by 13%. Rosuvastatin 40 mg was well tolerated during 96 weeks. The overall pattern and incidence of AEs and abnormal laboratory values were consistent with the published safety profile of rosuvastatin and higher doses of other statins. In conclusion, long-term treatment with rosuvastatin 40 mg is safe and effective in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Comparison of effectiveness of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin on the achievement of combined C-reactive protein (<2 mg/L) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (< 70 mg/dl) targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (from the ANDROMEDA study).
AB  - Decreasing C-reactive protein (CRP) in addition to decreasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol may further decrease coronary heart disease risk. The effects of rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin in achieving a combined target of LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl and CRP <2 mg/L in 509 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was evaluated. CRP decreased significantly versus baseline in both treatment groups. Significantly more patients treated with rosuvastatin achieved the combined end point of LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl and CRP <2 mg/L compared with atorvastatin by the end of the study period (58% vs 37%; p <0.001 vs atorvastatin). In conclusion, CRP was effectively decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving rosuvastatin or atorvastatin, whereas rosuvastatin decreased LDL cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin.

TI  - Chronic treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin reverses endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in hypercholesterolaemia.
AB  - In hypercholesterolaemia, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress can be reversed by chronic oral treatment with BH(4). Thus, BH(4) availability is essential for maintaining NO synthesis and low O(2)(-) production by endothelial NOS in vivo, and may provide a rational therapeutic approach to prevent cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Decreased plasma soluble RAGE in patients with hypercholesterolemia: effects of statins.
AB  - The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is overexpressed at sites of vascular pathology. A soluble RAGE isoform (sRAGE) neutralizes the ligand-mediated damage by acting as a decoy. We hypothesized that in hypercholesterolemia up-regulation of the ligand-RAGE axis may bridge impairment of nitric oxide biosynthesis with oxidative stress. We measured in 60 hypercholesterolemic patients and 20 controls plasma total sRAGE levels, urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) excretion, and plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). The effects of two structurally different statins (pravastatin and atorvastatin) on these parameters were analyzed in 20 hypercholesterolemic subjects free of vascular disease. Plasma sRAGE was significantly lower, ADMA and urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) were higher, in hypercholesterolemic versus normocholesterolemic patients. Patients on statin treatment with previous myocardial infarction had lower 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), higher sRAGE, and unchanged ADMA levels compared to subjects free of vascular disease. On multivariate regression analysis only 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and ADMA predicted sRAGE levels. An 8-week treatment with either statin was associated with a significant reduction in urinary 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), whereas only atorvastatin raised sRAGE levels near to normal values, with no change in ADMA levels. sRAGE might serve as an endogenous protecting factor for accelerated atherosclerosis mediated by oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Randomised study to compare the efficacy and safety of isapgol plus atorvastatin versus atorvastatin alone in subjects with hypercholesterolaemia.
AB  - Soluble fibre has been shown to augment the cholesterol-lowering effects of low-fat diets in individuals with mild to moderate hypercholesterolaemia. Combination therapy with a statin poses advantages in certain settings and may allow use of lower doses of multiple drugs rather than maximum doses of a single drug. The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of combination of isapgol and atorvastatin versus atorvastatin alone, in the same dose, in reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total-cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolaemic patients after 12 weeks of therapy. In a 12-week study, 100 subjects from both sexes and of > 20 years having hyperlipidaemia, with LDL-C level > 130 mg/dl and total cholesterol > 220 mg/dl were included, and were randomised to receive either a combination of isapgol powder (Naturolax) 5.6 g twice daily and atorvastatin 10 mg once daily or atorvastatin 10 mg once daily alone orally. Serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride were assessed at 8 and 12 weeks. Ninety-seven patients completed the study. At the end of the 8th week, both the groups had a significant reduction in mean LDL-C (20.5% in isapgol + atorvastatin group and 16.0% among atorvastatin alone group) as compared to baseline. But between the groups, however, the difference was not significant. At the end of the 12th week fall in LDL-C at 31.4% for isapgol + atorvastatin was significantly greater than 22.8% among the atorvastatin group (p < 0.05). Serum total cholesterol, HDL-C and triglyceride were significantly lowered within the groups at 8th and 12th weeks but between groups, the difference was not significant. Comparison of adverse events profile in both the groups shows that more number of patients from atorvastatin alone group (n = 14, 28%) had adverse reactions than the number of patients from the combination group (n = 4, 8%; p < 005).
