TI  - [Clinical research of safflower injection on hibernating myocardial revascularization].
AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death. Safflower attracts great attention owing to its anti-ischemia/reperfusion injury effect. Ninety-three patients with CAD were included and randomized into safflower treatment group, PCI group and control group. Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) was performed to measure end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and wall motion score index (WMSI) to determine the recovery of hibernating myocardium and cardiac function in all patients before treatment and after 3-month follow-up. The study was to investigate the effects of safflower on hibernating myocardial revascularization and cardiac function. It was found that LVEF was significantly improved, while the ESV and WMSI were significantly reduced after 2-week treatment in safflower and PCI treatment groups. No significant differences were found between safflower and PCI treatment groups in ESV, EDV, WMSI and LVEF after treatment Safflower injection effectively improved hibernating myocardial function.

TI  - Efficacy of pre-hospital use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction before mechanical reperfusion in a rapid-transfer network (from the Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry of Brittany).
AB  - Previous studies investigating prehospital use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction reached conflicting conclusions. The benefit of this strategy in addition to in-ambulance loading of dual-antiplatelet therapy remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze data from a prospective registry of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions admitted <24 hours after symptom onset (July 2006 to May 2012). A total of 2,052 patients managed in a physician-staffed mobile intensive care unit (MICU)<12 hours after symptom onset and scheduled for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) were retrospectively included. Patients who received GPIs in the MICU were compared with those who did not. The primary end point was infarct-related artery patency, defined as pre-PPCI Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3. GPIs were administered in the MICU to 737 patients (36%), including 430<2 hours after symptom onset, and 1,315 patients (64%) did not received prehospital GPIs. Pre-PPCI TIMI flow grade 3 rate was lower in patients treated in the MICU (17.2% vs 21.3%, p=0.03) because of patients treated >2 hours after symptom onset, of whom only 12.7% reached the primary end point. There was no significant difference between groups in the rate of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events. In conclusion, prehospital GPI use in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions<12 hours after symptom onset scheduled for PPCI neither improved pre-PPCI infarct-related artery patency nor reduced in-hospital major adverse cardiac events.

TI  - Body mass index and acute and long-term outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial).
AB  - The clinical outcome of acute cardiovascular events may be more favorable in patients with a high body mass index (BMI), although obesity increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases. The authors sought to define the association between BMI and acute and long-term outcome of patients presenting within 12hours of ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a large multinational cohort. A total of 3,579 patients enrolled in the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial were stratified according to BMI quartiles: <24.5, 24.5 to <27.1, 27.1 to 30.1, and >30.1kg/m(2) (quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Death, myocardial reinfarction, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization, stroke, and noncoronary artery bypass grafting-related major bleeding events were centrally adjudicated for the acute, 30days, and yearly follow-up. Patients with a BMI in the highest quartile were younger than patients in the lower BMI quartiles and more frequently had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Complete occlusions and noncalcified lesions were more common in patients with a high BMI. In-hospital mortality decreased with increasing BMI due to lower cardiac mortality (2.9%, 2.3%, 1.2%, and 1.0% for quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, p<0.05). Out-of-hospital 3-year mortality was also lower in higher-weight patients due to lower noncardiac mortality (4.2%, 2.6%, 2.3%, and 1.7% for quartiles 1 to 4, respectively, p= 0.01). After adjustment for covariates, BMI was no longer predictive of acute or long-term mortality after STEMI. In conclusion, as BMI increases, patients have a more extensive adjusted cardiovascular risk profile and disease burden and premature STEMI onset but similar adjusted acute and long-term outcomes.

TI  - Efficacy of early intensive rosuvastatin therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (ROSEMARY Study).
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate whether early high-dose potent statin therapy in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention can reduce infarct size compared with conventional low-dose statin therapy. In a randomized placebo-controlled multicenter trial, 185 patients were assigned either to an early high-dose rosuvastatin group (n= 92, rosuvastatin 40mg before treatment plus maintenance for 7days) or to a conventional low-dose rosuvastatin group (n= 93, placebo before treatment plus rosuvastatin 10-mg maintenance for 7days). Serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed during the acute (3 to 7days) and chronic (3months) phases. The primary end point was relative infarct volume assessed by MRI at 3months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups, except hypertension, which was more prevalent in the high-dose group. Serial MRI data were available for 121 patients (high-dose group n= 54 and low-dose group n= 67). The relative infarct volumes in the acute (23.0  9.5% vs 20.5  11.7%, p= 0.208) and chronic (15.9  8.3% vs 15.8  9.7%, p= 0.943) phases were not different between the groups. No differences between groups were observed for periprocedural microvascular circulation evaluated by Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade, myocardial blush grade, ST-segment resolution, microvascular obstruction on cardiac MRI, or clinical outcomes. In conclusion, early high-dose rosuvastatin therapy in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention did not improve periprocedural myocardial perfusion or reduce infarct volume measured by MRI compared with the conventional low-dose rosuvastatin regimen.

TI  - Frequency of nonsystem delays in ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention and implications for door-to-balloon time reporting (from the American Heart Association Mission: Lifeline program).
AB  - The percentage of patients with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with door-to-balloon (D2B) times 90minutes is used as a hospital performance measure for public reporting. Patients can be excluded from reporting for nonsystem-related delays. How exclusions impact D2B time reporting at the hospital level is unknown. The percentage of patients having nonsystem delays for primary PCI at the hospital level was calculated using data from the Acute Coronary Treatment Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get with the Guidelines Registry. Hospitals were categorized based on tertiles of percentage of excluded patients: low, 7.1%; intermediate, >7.1% to 11.2%; and high, >11.2%. From January 1, 2007, to March 31, 2011, 43,909 patients from 294 hospitals were included. The percentage of exclusions differed substantially among hospitals (0% to 68%, median 9.2% [interquartile range 5.6% to 13.5%]). Exclusion reasons included vascular access difficulty (7.6%), cardiac arrest/intubation (38%), and PCI procedural difficulties (20%). Including patients with nonsystem delays significantly increased D2B times by 2minutes for each group. The effect was larger on the proportion of patients having a D2B 90minutes (low 83.6% to 85%, intermediate 82.9% to 86.3%, high 82% to 87.5%, p<0.001, for all). If a criterion of having 90% of patients with D2B 90minutes was used, excluding patients with nonsystem delays significantly increased the proportion of patients meeting this goal for each group: low, 28% to 37%; intermediate, 17.7% to 37.5%; and high, 14% to 52% (all p <0.01). In conclusion, the proportion of patients excluded from D2B reporting varies substantially among hospitals. This has a greater impact on percentage of patients with D2B time 90minutes than on median D2B times.

TI  - Comparison of 5-year survival after acute myocardial infarction using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor versus angiotensin II receptor blocker.
AB  - Few studies have investigated whether angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is a practical alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) for long-term use after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in real-world practice in the percutaneous coronary intervention era. We compared 5-year survival benefits of ACEI and ARB in patients with AMI registered in the Osaka Acute Coronary Insufficiency Study. Study subjects were divided into 3 groups: ACEI (n= 4,425), ARB (n= 2,158), or patients without either drug (n=2,442). A total of 661 deaths were recorded. Cox regression analysis revealed that treatment with either ACEI or ARB was associated with reduced 5-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.83, p <0.001 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98, p= 0.03, respectively). However, Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression analyses based on propensity score revealed that ACEI was associated with better survival than ARB from 2 to 5years after survival discharge (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74, p <0.001). These findings were confirmed in a propensity score-matched population. In conclusion, treatment with ACEI was associated with better 5-year survival after AMI.

TI  - Impact of functional mitral regurgitation on right ventricular function and outcome in patients with right ventricular infarction.
AB  - Right ventricular (RV) infarction is associated with increased mortality. Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) may complicate inferoposterior infarction with RV involvement leading to pulmonary hypertension and increased RV afterload, potentially exacerbating RV remodeling and dysfunction. We studied 179 patients with inferior wall left ventricular (LV) ST-elevation myocardial infarction and RV infarction. The presence and severity of FMR and RV function were assessed by echocardiography. FMR was diagnosed based on echocardiographic criteria and when the severity of regurgitation was moderate. Eighteen patients (10.0%) had moderate FMR. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was higher in patients with FMR than in patients without FMR (43  10 vs 34  10 mmHg, respectively, p= 0.002). RV systolic dysfunction was present in 76 patients (42.5%). FMR was a strong predictor of RV dysfunction (odds ratio 5.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65 to 17.48, p= 0.005) independent of reperfusion therapy. During a median follow-up of 4.1years, 20 (12.4%) and 10 (55.6%) deaths occurred in patients with and without FMR, respectively (p <0.001). In a multivariable Cox regression model, compared with patients without FMR and with normal RV function, the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 1.02 in patients without FMR and with RV dysfunction (95% CI 0.39 to 2.69, p= 0.97) and 3.62 in patients with FMR with RV dysfunction (95% CI 1.33 to 9.85, p= 0.01). In conclusion, in patients with RV infarction, the development of concomitant hemodynamically significant FMR is associated with RV dysfunction. The risk for mortality is increased predominantly in patients with both RV dysfunction and FMR.

TI  - Comparison of left ventricular function following first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention in men versus women.
AB  - Previous data reported worse outcomes in female patients after acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), related at least in part to less aggressive and nonparallel treatment. We investigated the presence of gender differences in left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in patients presenting with first STEMI, treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Study population included 187 consecutive patients (81% men) presenting with STEMI and treated by primary PCI and guideline-based medications. Their mean age was 58  10 years. All patients underwent a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation within 3 days of admission. Female patients were older (62  11 vs 59  10 years, p = 0.006), with more co-morbidities and longer symptom duration (490  436 vs 365  437 minutes, p = 0.013). Echocardiography demonstrated that female patients had significantly lower LV systolic function (47  8% vs 45  8%, p = 0.03), lower septal and lateral e' velocities, higher average E/e' ratio (all p <0.001), elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (p = 0.03), and worse diastolic dysfunction (p = 0.007). No significant changes were present in left atrial volumes. In a logistic multivariate analysis model, female gender emerged as an independent predictor of septal e' <8 cm/s (odds ratio 10.11, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 82.32, p = 0.002) and E/average e' ratio >15 (odds ratio 6.47, 95% confidence interval 1.63 to 25.61, p = 0.008). In conclusion, female patients undergoing primary PCI for first STEMI demonstrated worse systolic and diastolic LV function, despite receiving similar treatment as male patients.

TI  - Effect of one-cycle remote ischemic preconditioning to reduce myocardial injury during percutaneous coronary intervention.
AB  - Up to 1/3 of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) are complicated by troponin release. Remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC) confers effective cardioprotection; however, a 30-minute remote IPC protocol may be difficult to implement during ad hoc PCI. This study was performed to assess the ability of a brief remote IPC protocol to attenuate cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release after ad hoc PCI. Ninety-four patients undergoing ad hoc PCI for stable coronary artery disease, with undetectable preprocedural cTnI, were recruited and randomized to receive remote IPC (induced by one 5-minute inflation of a blood pressure cuff to 200 mm Hg around the upper arm) or control after the decision for PCI was made. The primary outcome was the difference between cTnI levels 24 hours after PCI and cTnI levels before coronary angiography (cTnI). cTnI in the remote IPC group was significantly lower compared with the control group (0.04 ng/ml [interquartile range 0.01 to 0.14] vs 0.19 ng/ml [interquartile range 0.18 to 0.59], p <0.001). The incidence of PCI-related myocardial infarction (MI) was greater in the control group (42.6% vs 19.1%, p = 0.014). In multivariate analysis, remote IPC was independently associated with cTnI and PCI-related MI. In conclusion, our results suggest that even 1 cycle of remote IPC immediately before ad hoc PCI attenuates periprocedural cTnI release and reduces the incidence of type 4a MI.

TI  - Trends in acute myocardial infarction event rates and risk of recurrences after an incident event in Norway 1994 to 2009 (from a Cardiovascular Disease in Norway Project).
AB  - We explored trends in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) event rates in Norway during 1994 to 2009 and trends in the 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year risk of recurrences after an incident AMI during 2001 to 2008 in men and women 25 years. Trends in AMI event rates (incident and recurrent) were analyzed using joinpoint regression analyses and expressed as annual percentage change (APC) in rates. Trends in AMI recurrences were explored using conditional risk models for ordered events in Cox regression. Analyses were stratified by gender and age group. Overall, AMI rates were stable during 1994 to 2002 but declined during 2002 to 2009 (APC = -2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.1 to -0.9 in men; APC = -2.1; 95% CI -3.8 to -0.5 in women). In the younger age group, rates declined during the whole study period in men (APC = -0.6; 95% CI -1.0 to -0.3) but not in women. Among older patients, no changes were observed during 1994 to 2002, whereas rates declined during 2002 to 2009 (APC = -2.6; 95% CI -3.8 to -1.4 in men; APC = -2.4; 95% CI -4.0 to -0.7 in women). During 2001 to 2008, in the older age group, the 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year risks of recurrences were reduced annually by 4.7%, 4.3%, and 5.4% in men and 5.2%, 5.0%, and 5.7% in women (all ptrend <0.001), respectively. No changes were observed in the younger age group. In conclusion, favorable trends in AMI event rates and recurrences observed in Norway were mostly seen among patients aged 65+ years, whereas less favorable trends were observed among younger patients, especially among women.

TI  - Changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels after discharge for acute myocardial infarction in a real-world patient population.
AB  - Aggressively managing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after myocardial infarction (MI) is a cornerstone of secondary prevention. The changes in LDL-C after MI and the factors associated with LDL-C levels are unknown. Therefore, we directly measured fasting LDL-C levels in 797 MI patients from 24 US hospitals from 2005 to 2008. Mean LDL-C levels at discharge, 1 month, and 6 months were 95.1, 81.9, and 87.1 mg/dL, respectively. In a hierarchical, multivariable, repeated measures model, older age, male sex, and hypertension were associated with lower LDL-C levels, whereas self-reported avoidance of health care because of cost was associated with higher LDL-C. Both the presence and intensity of statin therapy at discharge were strongly associated with LDL-C levels, with adjusted mean 6-month changes of -3.4 mg/dL (95% confidence interval (CI): -12.1, 5.3) for no statins; 1.7 mg/dL (95% CI: -4.7, 8.1) for low statins; -10.2 mg/dL (95% CI: -14.5, -6.0) for moderate statins; and -13.9 mg/dL (95% CI: -19.7, -8.0) for intensive statins (P < 0.001). In conclusion, we found that greater reductions in LDL-C levels after MI were strongly associated with the presence and intensity of statin therapy, older age, male sex, hypertension, and better socioeconomic status. These findings support the use of intensive statin therapy in post-MI patients and provide estimates of the expected LDL-C changes after MI in a real-world population.

AB  - It is not known whether the extent and severity of nonculprit coronary lesions correlate with outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We sought to quantify complex plaques in patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI and to determine their effect on short- and long-term clinical outcomes by examining the core laboratory database for plaque analysis from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction study. Baseline demographic, angiographic, and procedural details were compared between patients with single versus multiple complex plaques who underwent single-vessel PCI. Multivariable analysis was performed for predictors of long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), a combined end point of death, reinfarction, ischemic target-vessel revascularization, or stroke, and for death alone. Single-vessel PCI was performed in 3,137 patients (87%): 2,174 (69%) had multiple complex plaques and 963 (31%) had a single complex plaque. Compared with those with a single complex plaque, patients with multiple complex plaques were older (p <0.0001) and had more co-morbidities. The presence of multiple complex plaques was an independent predictor of 3-year MACE (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.98, p <0.0001), and death alone (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.70, p = 0.03). In conclusion, multiple complex plaques are present in the majority of patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI, and their presence is an independent predictor of short- and long-term MACE, including death (Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction; NCT00433966).

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease: data from the Heart and Soul Study.
AB  - A growing body of evidence supports an association between vitamin D and cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. From 2000 to 2002, we identified 946 participants with stable cardiovascular disease in San Francisco, California, and followed them prospectively for cardiovascular events (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death). We then examined the extent to which the association was attenuated by adjustment for poor health behaviors, comorbid health conditions, and potential biological mediators. During a median follow-up period of 8.0 years (through August 24, 2012), 323 subjects (34.1%) experienced a cardiovascular event. Following adjustment for sociodemographic factors, season of blood measurement, health behaviors, and comorbid conditions, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels under 20 ng/mL remained independently associated with cardiovascular events (hazard ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.67). However, after further adjustment for potential biological mediators, the independent association was no longer present (hazard ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 0.85, 1.44). Parathyroid hormone, a potentially modifiable biological factor downstream from 25-hydroxyvitamin D, was responsible for the majority of this attenuation. These findings highlight the need for randomized controlled trials to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in persons with deficiency could be beneficial for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.

TI  - Decade-long trends in the magnitude, treatment, and outcomes of patients aged 30 to 54 years hospitalized with ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.
AB  - Although acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurs primarily in the elderly, this disease also affects young adults. Few studies have, however, presented data on relatively young patients hospitalized with AMI. The objectives of this population-based study were to examine recent trends in the magnitude, clinical characteristics, management, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes associated with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in patients aged 30 to 54 years. We reviewed the medical records of 955 residents of the Worcester (Massachusetts) metropolitan area aged 30 to 54 years who were hospitalized for an initial STEMI or NSTEMI in 6 biennial periods from 1999 to 2009 at 11 greater Worcester medical centers. From 1999 to 2009, the proportion of young adults hospitalized with an STEMI decreased from approximately 2/3 to 2/5 of all patients with an initial AMI. Patients with STEMI were less likely to have a history of heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and kidney disease than those with NSTEMI. Both groups received similar effective medical therapies during their acute hospitalization. In-hospital clinical complications and mortality were low and no significant differences in these end points were observed between patients with STEMI and NSTEMI or with regard to 1-year postdischarge death rates (1.9% vs 2.8%). The present results demonstrate recent decreases in the proportion of relatively young patients diagnosed with an initial STEMI. Patients with STEMI and NSTEMI had similar in-hospital outcomes and long-term survival. Trends in these and other important outcomes warrant continued monitoring.

TI  - [The influence of ozone therapy on oxygen metabolism kinetics and the microcirculation system during spa and resort treatment of the post-infarction patients].
AB  - This study was designed to estimate the influence of ozone therapy on oxygen metabolism kinetics and the circulation system during spa and resort treatment of 145 post-infarction patients who survived myocardial infarction. All of them were given routine spa-and-resort therapy; 56 patients received pharmacotherapy, in the remaining 89 it was supplemented with ozone-therapy. The clinical examination included electrocardiography, veloergometry, echocardiography; kinetics of oxygen metabolism was evaluated by transcutaneous polarography, laser Doppler flowmetry, and computed capillaroscopy. The results of the study indicate that ozonetherapy in combination with medicamental treatment reduces the period of post-infarction rehabilitation, decreases tissue hypoxia, improves characteristics of microcirculation and general health status of the patients.

TI  - Effect of statin treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular systolic dysfunction according to the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.
AB  - The effects of statins on the prognosis of patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction remain controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of statin treatment on clinical outcomes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with LV systolic dysfunction. A total of 5,119 AMI patients with LV ejection fraction less than 50% on the initial echocardiogram were analyzed in the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry. The study population was divided into 4 groups according to the level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and statin treatment: low hs-CRP (hs-CRP  2.0 mg/L) and high hs-CRP (hs-CRP > 2 mg/L) with or without statin therapy. We evaluated the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) including cardiac death, reinfarction, target lesion revascularization, and coronary artery bypass grafting during a 12-month period in each group. Statin therapy did not significantly prevent the MACEs in the low hs-CRP groups (with statin: 10.1% versus without statin: 12.0%, P = 0.249). In the high hs-CRP groups, however, the incidence of MACEs was significantly decreased with statin treatment (with statin: 11.3%, without statin: 20.8%, P < 0.001). These findings were consistently observed in all subgroups of the high-hs CRP group, including the subgroup with an LV ejection fraction less than 40%. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis of the high hs-CRP group, lack of statin therapy was a significant predictor of MACE incidence (odds ratio: 1.573, 95% confidence interval: 1.079-2.293, P = 0.018). The statin treatment was associated with better outcome in AMI and LV dysfunction patients with hs-CRP  2 mg/dL.

TI  - Outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction treated with clopidogrel versus prasugrel (from the INFUSE-AMI trial).
AB  - Prasugrel is more potent than clopidogrel, but it is not known whether this translates into clinical benefit in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bivalirudin for ST elevation myocardial infarction. In the Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients With Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction trial, 452 patients with anterior STEMI undergoing primary PCI with bivalirudin were randomized to intralesional abciximab or placebo and to thrombus aspiration or no aspiration. Clopidogrel or prasugrel were administered at physician discretion. The primary end point was infarct size at 30days by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical events at 30days and 1year were independently adjudicated. Propensity score was used to adjust for nonrandom allocation of the drugs. Prasugrel and clopidogrel were administered to 155 patients (34.3%) and 297 patients (65.7%), respectively. Patients receiving prasugrel were younger with higher left ventricular ejection fraction and greater use of drug-eluting stents. Prasugrel-treated patients had higher rates of procedural success (94% vs 89%, p= 0.03), Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow (95% vs 90%, p= 0.06), and lower corrected TIMI frame counts (21  6 vs 23  11, p= 0.008). At 30days, infarct size was marginally lower in the prasugrel group (median [interquartile range]= 16.4% [6.5 to 20.0] vs 17.6% [8.1 to 25.7], p= 0.06). At 1year, prasugrel group had significantly fewer deaths (1.3% vs 8.3%, p= 0.004) and fewer episodes of severe heart failure (2.0% vs 7.7%, p= 0.02). These findings persisted after propensity score adjustment. There were no significant differences in major bleeding. Stent thrombosis was 0% versus 2.5%, respectively, p= 0.054. We conclude that prasugrel was associated with improved efficacy and similar safety compared with clopidogrel in patients undergoing primary PCI with bivalirudin.

TI  - Lessons learned from the design and implementation of myocardial infarction adjudication tailored for HIV clinical cohorts.
AB  - We developed, implemented, and evaluated a myocardial infarction (MI) adjudication protocol for cohort research of human immunodeficiency virus. Potential events were identified through the centralized Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems data repository using MI diagnoses and/or cardiac enzyme laboratory results (1995-2012). Sites assembled de-identified packets, including physician notes and results from electrocardiograms, procedures, and laboratory tests. Information pertaining to the specific antiretroviral medications used was redacted for blinded review. Two experts reviewed each packet, and a third review was conducted if discrepancies occurred. Reviewers categorized probable/definite MIs as primary or secondary and identified secondary causes of MIs. The positive predictive value and sensitivity for each identification/ascertainment method were calculated. Of the 1,119 potential events that were adjudicated, 294 (26%) were definite/probable MIs. Almost as many secondary (48%) as primary (52%) MIs occurred, often as the result of sepsis or cocaine use. Of the patients with adjudicated definite/probable MIs, 78% had elevated troponin concentrations (positive predictive value = 57%, 95% confidence interval: 52, 62); however, only 44% had clinical diagnoses of MI (positive predictive value = 45%, 95% confidence interval: 39, 51). We found that central adjudication is crucial and that clinical diagnoses alone are insufficient for ascertainment of MI. Over half of the events ultimately determined to be MIs were not identified by clinical diagnoses. Adjudication protocols used in traditional cardiovascular disease cohorts facilitate cross-cohort comparisons but do not address issues such as identifying secondary MIs that may be common in persons with human immunodeficiency virus.

TI  - Definitions of periprocedural myocardial infarction as surrogates for catheterization laboratory quality or clinical trial end points.
AB  - A consensus on what constitutes a clinically meaningful periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) remains highly debated. We evaluated the accuracy of 2 PMI definitions currently implemented for quality outcome assessment and clinical trial end points. Patients who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention with normal baseline troponin-I and creatine kinase-MB were included. PMI was defined according to either the 2007 Task Force (National Cardiovascular Database Registry [NCDR] CathPCI Registry) definition or the updated 2012 Task Force definition. Multivariate analysis was performed for the end point of 1-year all-cause death or myocardial infarction (MI). Of the 7,333 patients included, 31.9% and 2.1% were identified as having a PMI by NCDR or 2012 definition, respectively. Mean age was 6611 years; 66.8% were men, 1.40.9 stents implanted per patient, 84.5% bivalirudin use, and 29.7 type C lesions. Death or MI occurred in 5.6% of NCDR and 6.6% of 2012 defined patients. Neither biomarker was independently associated with death or MI for either definition (NCDR odds ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.5, p=0.34; 2012 Task Force odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 3.0, p=0.38). Only a modest correlation exists for either definition to predict death or MI, which did not improve for the 2012 definition. In conclusion, PMI definitions currently used for catheterization lab quality metrics and those used for clinical trial end points have poor discrimination for adverse events. Although the 2012 definition drastically reduced the number of PMIs defined, it did not decrease the predictive accuracy over the NCDR definition.

TI  - Comparison of outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction discharged on versus not on statin therapy (from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial).
AB  - Statin therapy is indicated after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to reduce recurrent ischemic events, but approximately 6% of patients with STEMI do not receive a statin prescription at discharge. This substudy aimed to define the clinical outcomes and patient characteristics associated with statin nonprescription after STEMI. We compared clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics and in-hospital, 30-day, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year outcomes in 3,512 patients discharged after STEMI with and without (6%) statin prescriptions in the harmonizing outcomes with revascularization and stents in acute myocardial infarction trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00433966). Statin nonprescription was associated with female sex, nonwhite race, previous bypass surgery, heart failure, renal impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, care in the United States, lower prescription rates of antiplatelets and neurohormonal antagonists, less percutaneous coronary intervention and stents, and, in 26% of cases, angiographically normal or nonobstructed coronary arteries. At every time point of follow-up after discharge, patients with no discharge statin prescription had significantly higher rates of net adverse clinical events, major adverse cardiac events, major bleeding unrelated to bypass surgery, and death. After multivariable adjustment, absence of a discharge statin prescription independently predicted 3-year major adverse cardiac event (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.07, p=0.0037) and death (hazard ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.41 to 3.77, p=0.0009). In conclusion, within the framework of this randomized trial of patients presenting with STEMI, approximately 6% of patients were discharged without statin therapy. Absence of a discharge statin prescription after STEMI was an independent predictor of ischemic events including death.

TI  - Comparison of percutaneous coronary intervention for previously treated versus de novo culprit lesions in acute myocardial infarction patients: insights from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry.
AB  - Despite greater co-morbidity burden, MI patients with prior PCI had lower mortality compared with patients undergoing their first intervention. Among patients with prior PCI, patients undergoing PCI to a previously treated culprit lesion were associated with lower mortality than those being intervened for a de novo culprit.

TI  - Patterns and predictors of intensive statin therapy among patients with diabetes mellitus after acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - Intensive statin therapy is a central component of secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly among high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the frequency and predictors of intensive statin therapy use after AMI among patients with DM have not been described. We examined patterns of intensive statin therapy use (defined as a statin with expected low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering of >50%) at discharge among patients with AMI with known DM enrolled in a 24-site US registry. Predictors of intensive statin therapy use were evaluated using multivariable hierarchical Poisson regression models. Among 1,300 patients with DM after AMI, 22% were prescribed intensive statin therapy at hospital discharge. In multivariable models, ST-elevation AMI (risk ratio [RR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29 to 1.70), insurance for medications (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.63), and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (RR 1.05 per 1mg/dl, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.07) were independent predictors of intensive statin therapy, whereas higher Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events scores were associated with lower rates of intensive statin therapy (RR 0.94 per 10 points, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98). In conclusion, only 1 in 5 patients with DM was prescribed intensive statin therapy at discharge after an AMI. Predictors of intensive statin therapy use suggest important opportunities to improve quality of care in this patient population.

TI  - Impact of hemodynamic support with Impella 2.5 versus intra-aortic balloon pump on prognostically important clinical outcomes in patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (from the PROTECT II randomized trial).
AB  - A periprocedural myocardial infarction, defined as the advent of new Q-waves or a creatine kinase-MB elevation >83 normal has been previously validated as predictive of subsequent mortality. We examined the effects of using this clinically relevant definition of periprocedural myocardial infarction instead of the original protocol definition on outcomes in the recent PROTECT II [A Prospective, Multi-center, Randomized Controlled Trial of the IMPELLA RECOVER LP 2.5 System Versus Intra Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) in Patients Undergoing Non Emergent High Risk PCI] trial. In this trial, patients who were undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomized to either an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP, n[211) or a left ventricular assist device (Impella, n[216). All eligible patients per study protocol were included in the analysis. Patient outcomes were compared up to 90 days, the longest available follow-up, on the composite end points of major adverse events (MAE) and major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE [ death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization). At 90 days, the rates of both composite end points were lower in the Impella group compared with the IABP group (MAE, 37% vs 49%, p [ 0.014 respectively; MACCE, 22% vs 31%, p [ 0.034 respectively). There were no differences in death or large myocardial infarction between the 2 arms. By multivariable analysis, treatment with Impella as opposed to IABP was an independent predictor for freedom from MAE (odds ratio[0.75 [95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.92], p[0.007) andMACCE (odds ratio[0.76 [95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.96], p[0.020) at 90 days postprocedure. In conclusion, hemodynamic support with Impella compared with IABP during high-risk PCI in the PROTECT-II trial resulted in improved event-free survival at 3-month follow-up; this finding was further supported by multivariate analyses.

TI  - Impact of the angiographic mechanisms underlying periprocedural myocardial infarction after drug-eluting stent implantation.
AB  - Periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) can be induced by several angiographic mechanisms. However, there are limited data on whether these mechanisms differentially affect clinical outcomes. The purpose of our study was to investigate the impact of periprocedural MI on mortality according to the underlying angiographic mechanisms after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. We pooled the databases from 7 coronary stent trials using DES. Periprocedural MI was classified according to its underlying angiographic mechanisms as type 1 (due to side-branch occlusion), type 2 (due to other angiographic complications), or type 3 (without angiographically identifiable causes). Among 10,889 patients treated with DES, 768 (7.1%) experienced periprocedural MI; 463 cases (60.3%) were driven by type 1 cause, 138 (18.0%) by type 2 cause, and 167 (21.7%) by type 3 cause. Mortality rates at 2 years were higher in patients with periprocedural MI than in those without (3.5% vs 2.1%, respectively). Significant differences in mortality were observed according to the angiographic mechanisms of MI (type 1: 2.8% vs type 2: 6.1% vs type 3: 3.1%). After multivariable adjustment, type 2 MI was significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio 2.65, 95% confidence interval 1.77 to 3.96), whereas type 1 and type 3 MI were not related with increased mortality. In conclusion, among patients receiving DES implantation, periprocedural MI was associated with increased mortality, and there were differential associations with mortality according to the underlying angiographic mechanisms.

TI  - Characteristics and outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention following cardiac arrest (from the NCDR).
AB  - Outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have been limited to small, mostly single-center studies. We compared patients who underwent PCI after CA included in the CathPCI Registry with those without CA. Patients with ST elevation were classified as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); all other patients having PCI were classified as without STEMI. Patients with CA in each group were compared with the corresponding non-CA groups for baseline characteristics, angiographic findings, and outcomes. A total of 594,734 patients underwent PCI, of whom 114,768 had STEMI, including 9,375 (8.2%) had CA, and 479,966 had without STEMI, including 2,775 (0.6%) had CA. Patients with CA were similar in age to patients with non-CA, with a lower frequency of coronary disease risk factors and known coronary disease. On angiography, patients with CA were significantly more likely to have more complex lesions with worse baseline thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow. Patients with CA were significantly more likely to have cardiogenic shock, both for patients with STEMI (51% vs 7.2%, respectively) and for patients without STEMI (38% vs 0.8%, respectively, both p<0.001). In-hospital mortality was substantially worse in patients with CA, for both patients with STEMI (24.9% vs 3.1%, respectively) and patients without STEMI (18.7% vs 0.4%, respectively). In conclusion, patients who underwent PCI after CA had more complex anatomy, more shock, and higher mortality. The substantially increased mortality in patients with CA has important implications for the development and regionalization of centers for CA.

TI  - 30-year trends in patient characteristics, treatment practices, and long-term outcomes of adults aged 35 to 54years hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - Much of our knowledge about the characteristics, clinical management, and postdischarge outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is derived from clinical studies in middle-aged and older subjects with little contemporary information available about the descriptive epidemiology of AMI in relatively young men and women. The objectives of our population-based study were to describe >3-decade-long trends in the clinical features, treatment practices, and long-term outcomes of young adults aged 35 to 54years discharged from the hospital after AMI. The study population consisted of 2,142 residents of the Worcester (Massachusetts) metropolitan area who were hospitalized with AMI at all central Massachusetts medical centers during 16 annual periods from 1975 to 2007. Our primarily male study population had an average age of 47years. Patients hospitalized during the most recent decade (1997 to 2007) under study were more likely to have a history of hypertension and heart failure than those hospitalized during earlier study years. Patients were less likely to have developed heart failure or stroke during their hospitalization in the most recent compared with the initial decade under study (heart failure 13.7% and stroke 0.7% vs 20.9% and 2.0%, respectively). One- and 2-year postdischarge death rates also decreased significantly between 1975 to 1986 (6.2% and 9.0%, respectively) and 1988 to 1995 (2.6% and 4.9%). These trends were concomitant with the increasing use of effective cardiac therapies and coronary interventions during hospitalization. The present results provide insights into the changing characteristics, management, and improving long-term outcomes of relatively young patients hospitalized with AMI.

TI  - Patterns of statin initiation, intensification, and maximization among patients hospitalized with an acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - In a large, multicenter acute myocardial infarction cohort, statin therapy was begun in nearly 90% of patients during hospitalization, with no variability across sites; however, rates of statin intensification and maximization were low and varied substantially across hospitals. Given that more intense statin therapy is associated with better outcomes, changing the existing performance measures to include the intensity of statin therapy may improve care.

TI  - Variation in the incidence of hospital-acquired anemia during hospitalization with acute myocardial infarction (data from 57 US hospitals).
AB  - Development of hospital-acquired anemia (HAA) during acute myocardial infarction may be related to processes of care and is associated with poor outcomes. Little is known about variation in the incidence of HAA across hospitals or the hospital characteristics associated with HAA. We studied 17,676 patients with acute myocardial infarction without anemia at admission, defining HAA as a hemoglobin decline below anemia diagnostic thresholds and moderate-to-severe HAA as a hemoglobin decline to <11g/dl. We calculated median rate ratios (MRRs), the median value of the relative risk (RR) for HAA for 2 patients with identical characteristics presenting to 2 randomly selected hospitals, to identify variation in HAA adjusting for patient characteristics. Separate models were fit to test the association between hospital characteristics and HAA. HAA (57.5%) and moderate-to-severe HAA (20.1%) were common. The incidence of HAA varied substantially across hospitals and remained significant after multivariable adjustment (any HAA: MRR 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.13; moderate-to-severe HAA: MRR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.39). Adjusting for patient characteristics, teaching status (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97 vs nonteaching status), and region (Northeast vs Midwest: RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.19; West vs Midwest: RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.33, respectively) was associated with risk of HAA. Teaching status (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.9 vs nonteaching status) and region (South vs Midwest: RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.5) were independently associated with moderate-to-severe HAA. In conclusion, we observed significant variability in the incidence of HAA across hospitals and found a lower risk of HAA at teaching centers, suggesting that qualitative studies of the relation between HAA and processes of care are needed to identify targets for quality improvement.

TI  - Antiplatelet therapy for stable coronary artery disease in atrial fibrillation patients taking an oral anticoagulant: a nationwide cohort study.
AB  - In atrial fibrillation patients with stable coronary artery disease, the addition of antiplatelet therapy to VKA therapy is not associated with a reduction in risk of recurrent coronary events or thromboembolism, whereas risk of bleeding is increased significantly. The common practice of adding antiplatelet therapy to oral VKA anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation and stable coronary artery disease warrants reassessment.

TI  - Effect of direct renin inhibitor on left ventricular remodeling in patients with primary acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - Some patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have a poor prognosis due to left ventricular remodeling (LVR), resulting in the recurrence of congestive heart failure even when therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) has been initiated. We investigated the effect of early administration of the direct renin inhibitor (DRI) aliskiren in combination with an ACEI or an ARB on LVR using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in patients with AMI.Twenty-one consecutive patients were treated with an ACEI or an ARB (non-DRI group), and another 21 consecutive patients received aliskiren 150 mg/day combined with an ACEI or an ARB (DRI group). CMR imaging was performed 7 days after AMI and 10 months later.CMR imaging revealed no significant changes in LV end-systolic volume, LV end-diastolic volume, or LV ejection fraction between the patients with and without DRI aliskiren. In the DRI group, plasma renin activity was significantly lower in both the acute and chronic phases; however, aldosterone levels were significantly lower in the acute but not the chronic phase.A low dose of aliskiren may be insufficient to maintain suppression of aldosterone under current standard therapies with an ACEI or an ARB and -blocker in patients with primary AMI, and results in no attenuation of LVR.

Rhythmocardiograms were obtained before and after a morning sublingual dose of nitrates preceding intake of basal drugs. The results suggest negative action of nitrates on peripheral vegetative regulation of pacemaker activity of the synoatrial node.

TI  - Aspiration thrombectomy in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (from the Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey 2010).
AB  - We assessed the impact of aspiration thrombectomy (AT) in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) on major adverse cardiac events at 30 days and 1-year mortality in 517 consecutive patients who were included in the prospective, nationwide, multicenter, observational Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey in 2010. Two hundred seventeen patients (42%) underwent AT (AT-PPCI) and 300 patients conventional (C) PPCI. Both groups had similar infarct-related artery distribution and ostial or proximal culprit lesion. Patients in AT-PPCI versus C-PPCI had lower systolic blood pressure and worse Killip class on admission, more frequent Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 0 or 1 before PPCI (80% vs 56%), less frequent restoration of flow after indwelling a guidewire in the infarct-related artery (32% vs 52%), and more use of IIb/IIIa glycoprotein inhibitors (69% vs 49%), respectively (p 0.05 for all comparisons). Thirty-day major adverse cardiac events was similar in the AT-PPCI and C-PPCI groups, 10.6% versus 9.7%, p = 0.73; adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 2.10, p = 0.95. One-year mortality was lower in the AT-PPCI versus C-PPCI group, 3.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.13; adjusted hazard ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.96, p = 0.042. In conclusion, this study of consecutive patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing PPCI demonstrates that AT was an independent predictor of reduced 1-year mortality.

TI  - Prognostic usefulness of left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiography in patients with atrial fibrillation (from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy Study).
AB  - It is unknown whether left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) diagnosis by electrocardiography improves risk stratification in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated the prognostic impact of LVH diagnosis by electrocardiography in a large sample of anticoagulated patients with AF included in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY) Study. We defined electrographic LVH (ECG-LVH) by strain pattern or Cornell voltage (R wave in aVL plus S wave in V3) >2.0 mV (women) or >2.4 mV (men). LVH prevalence was 22.7%. During a median follow-up of 2.0 years, 303 patients developed a stroke, 778 died (497 from cardiovascular causes), and 140 developed a myocardial infarction. LVH was associated with a greater risk of stroke (1.99% vs 1.32% per year, hazard ratio [HR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.93, p <0.001), cardiovascular death (4.52% vs 1.80% per year, HR 2.56, 95% CI 2.14 to 3.06, p <0.0001), all-cause death (6.03% vs 3.11% per year, HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.26, p <0.0001), and myocardial infarction (1.11% vs 0.55% per year, HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.92, p <0.0001). In multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of LVH was additive to CHA2DS2-VASc score and other covariates. The category-free net reclassification index and integrated discrimination improvement increased significantly after adding LVH to multivariate models. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that ECG-LVH, a simple and easily accessible prognostic indicator, improves risk stratification in anticoagulated patients with AF.

TI  - Trends in major entry site complications from percutaneous coronary intervention (from the Dynamic Registry).
AB  - Several factors contribute to the risk of percutaneous coronary intervention-related major entry site (MES) complications. We sought to examine the trends in MES among unselected patients during the stent era. Data from the Dynamic Registry including 5 distinct recruitment waves from 1997 to 2006 (n = 10,932) were used to assess baseline characteristics and MES among consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. MES was defined as bleeding requiring transfusion, pseudoaneurysm, arterial thrombosis or dissection, vascular complication requiring surgery, or retroperitoneal bleed. Uncomplicated hematomas were not included. Several trends were observed in baseline characteristics including an increase from wave 1 to wave 5 in body mass index >30 kg/m(2) (30.2% to 40.4%), renal disease (3.5% to 9.1%), diabetes (28.0% to 34.1%), and hypertension (59.4% to 78%; ptrend <0.001 for all). The use of a thienopyridine increased significantly from wave 1 (49.7%) to wave 5 (84%), whereas glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use peaked in wave 3 (53.1%) and then decreased (p <0.001). Access site was predominately femoral, but radial access increased over time (0.3% wave 1, 6.6% wave 5, p 0.0001). The rates of MES (2.8% to 2.2%, ptrend = 0.01) and MES requiring transfusion (2.0% to 0.74%, ptrend <0.001) were low and decreased with time. The trend in less risk for MES in later time periods remained after adjustment. In conclusion, MES has decreased over time; however, opportunity for bleeding avoidance strategies still exists.

TI  - Tight versus standard blood pressure control in patients with hypertension with and without cardiovascular disease.
AB  - An excessive blood pressure (BP) reduction might be dangerous in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. In the Studio Italiano Sugli Effetti CARDIOvascolari del Controllo della Pressione Arteriosa SIStolica (Cardio-Sis), 1111 nondiabetic patients with systolic BP 150 mm Hg were randomly assigned to a systolic BP target <140 mm Hg (standard control) or <130 mm Hg (tight control). We stratified patients by absence (n=895) or presence (n=216) of established cardiovascular disease at entry. Antihypertensive treatment was open-label and tailored to each patient's needs. After 2-year follow-up, the primary end point of the study, electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, occurred less frequently in the tight than in the standard control group in the patients without (10.8% versus 15.2%) and with (14.1% versus 23.5%) established cardiovascular disease (P for interaction=0.82). The main secondary end point, a composite of cardiovascular events and all-cause death, occurred less frequently in the tight than in the standard control group both in patients without (1.47 versus 3.68 patient-years; P=0.016) and with (7.87 versus 11.22 patient-years; P=0.049) previous cardiovascular disease. In a multivariable Cox model, allocation to tight BP control reduced the risk of cardiovascular events to a similar extent in patients with or without overt cardiovascular disease at randomization (P for interaction=0.43). In conclusion, an intensive treatment aimed to lower systolic BP<130 mm Hg reduced left ventricular hypertrophy and improved clinical outcomes to a similar extent in patients with hypertension and without established cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Frequency of the use of low- versus high-dose aspirin in dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy study).
AB  - In randomized trials, low-dose (LD) and high-dose (HD) aspirin (ASA) are equally effective in reducing ischemic complications, but HD ASA is associated with an increased risk of bleeding in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). ASA dose after PCI varies across countries, but little is known about variation within the United States (US) and whether this variation can be explained by clinical characteristics of patients. We used enrollment data from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Study, a randomized trial designed to compare 12 versus 30months of dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI, to quantify the variation in ASA dosing after PCI in the US subjects and assess the extent to which dose variability was attributable to patient characteristics. Of the 23,336 patients enrolled in the US, 28.0% were prescribed LD ASA at discharge after PCI. Patient characteristics explained 1.6% of total variance in ASA dose, whereas the study site accounted for 45.9% of the unexplained variability. The median odds ratio comparing sites was 5.05 (95% confidence interval 4.29 to 5.85), which was greater than any individual predictor of ASA dose. In conclusion, LD ASA after PCI in the US was used in a minority of patients, and heterogeneity in its selection was mainly influenced by the site of enrollment rather than patient characteristics. As HD ASA may be associated with adverse events in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy, reducing local practice variation in the dose of ASA may be a target for quality improvement.

TI  - Natural killer (NK) cell deficit in coronary artery disease: no aberrations in phenotype but sustained reduction of NK cells is associated with low-grade inflammation.
AB  - Although reduced natural killer (NK) cell levels have been reported consistently in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the clinical significance and persistence of this immune perturbation is not clarified. In this study we characterized the NK cell deficit further by determining (i) differentiation surface markers and cytokine profile of NK cell subsets and (ii) ability to reconstitute NK cell levels over time. Flow cytometry was used to analyse NK cell subsets and the intracellular cytokine profile in 31 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 37 healthy controls. In blood collected prior to coronary angiography, the proportions of NK cells were reduced significantly in non-STEMI and SA patients compared with controls, whereas NK cell subset analyses or cytokine profile measurements did not reveal any differences across groups. During a 12-month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained high in patients with sustained NK cell deficit, whereas a decline in IL-6 (P < 0001) was seen in patients with a pronounced increase in NK cells. In conclusion, we found no evidence that reduction of NK cells in CAD patients was associated with aberrations in NK cell phenotype at any clinical stage of the disease. Conversely, failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with a persistent low-grade inflammation, suggesting a protective role of NK cells in CAD.

TI  - Transfer rates from nonprocedure hospitals after initial admission and outcomes among elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - Nonprocedure hospitals vary substantially in their use of the transfer process for elderly patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction. High-transfer hospitals had greater use of invasive cardiac procedures after admission compared with low-transfer hospitals. However, higher transfer rates were not associated with a significantly lower risk-standardized mortality rate at 30 days. Moreover, at 1 year there was only a 1.1% difference (42.8% vs 43.9%) between hospitals with higher and lower transfer rates. These findings suggest that, as a single intervention, promoting the transfer of patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction may not improve hospital outcomes.

TI  - Impact of patients' arrival time on the care and in-hospital mortality in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
AB  - Only a few studies have focused on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during off-hours. The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of patients' arrival time on the care of NSTEMI and whether this pattern might affect hospital mortality. This study analyzed 4,736 NSTEMI patients included in the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry from November 2005 to January 2008. Patients' arrival time was classified into regular hours (weekdays, 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) and off-hours (weekdays 18:01 p.m. to 8:59 a.m., weekends, and holidays). A subtotal of 2,225 (46.9%) patients was admitted during off hours, compared with 2,511 (53.1%) patients with regular-hour admission. A higher proportion of patients admitted during off-hours had a higher Killip class, had more frequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation, were less likely to receive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (67.7% vs 72.7%, p <0.001), and had longer door-to-balloon times (28 hours, interquartile range: 11 to 63 vs 23 hours, interquartile range 4 to 67, p <0.001). Although unadjusted hospital mortality was associated with admission during off-hours (4.5% vs 3.3%, p = 0.023), after adjusting for all patients covariates, the difference in mortality was attenuated and was no longer statistically significant (odds ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.48, p = 0.793). In conclusion, despite receiving fewer PCIs and having substantially longer waiting times to PCI, patients admitted during off-hours may not be at risk for increased in-hospital mortality. If patients are treated within an appropriate reperfusion strategy according to their clinical risk, arrival time may not influence on mortality.

TI  - Prognostic implications of procedural vs spontaneous myocardial infarction: results from the Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events (EVENT) registry.
AB  - Among patients undergoing PCI, spontaneous but not procedural MI was independently associated with death and cardiovascular death at 1 year. These finding suggest that the prognostic impact of procedural MI may be less than that of spontaneous MI and should be considered in designing end points for future studies of coronary revascularization.

TI  - Radial versus femoral approach comparison in percutaneous coronary intervention with intraaortic balloon pump support: the RADIAL PUMP UP registry.
AB  - In this observational registry, high-risk patients undergoing PCI and requiring IABP support appeared to have fewer NACEs if transradial access was used instead of transfemoral, mainly due to fewer access-related bleedings. Given the inherent limitations of this retrospective work, including the inability to adjust for unknown confounders, further controlled studies are warranted to confirm or refute these findings.

TI  - Rationale, design, and organization of a randomized, controlled Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS) in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.
AB  - Sitagliptin, an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, lowers blood glucose when administered as monotherapy or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. TECOS will evaluate the effects of adding sitagliptin to usual diabetes care on cardiovascular outcomes and clinical safety. TECOS is a pragmatic, academically run, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial recruiting approximately 14,000 patients in 38 countries who have type 2 diabetes (T2DM), are at least 50 years old, have cardiovascular disease, and have an hemoglobin A1c value between 6.5% and 8.0%. Eligible participants will be receiving stable mono- or dual therapy with metformin, sulfonylurea, or pioglitazone, or insulin alone or in combination with metformin. Randomization is 1:1 to double-blind sitagliptin or matching placebo, in addition to existing therapy in a usual care setting. Follow-up occurs at 4-month intervals in year 1 and then twice yearly until 1300 confirmed primary end points have occurred. Glycemic equipoise between randomized groups is a desired aim. The primary composite cardiovascular endpoint is time to the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, with cardiovascular events adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to study therapy. TECOS is a pragmatic-design cardiovascular outcome trial assessing the cardiovascular effects of sitagliptin when added to usual T2DM management.

TI  - Usefulness of serum unbound free fatty acid levels to predict death early in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (from the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] II trial).
AB  - Circulating total free fatty acid (FFA) levels are elevated early in myocardial infarction (MI) and have been associated with an increase in mortality. We investigated the association of serum unbound FFA (FFAu) levels with mortality in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation MI in the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction II trial. The Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction II trial enrolled patients within 4 hours of chest pain onset. The patients were treated with a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator within 1 hour of enrollment. The FFAu concentration was evaluated in serum samples from 1,834 patients obtained at baseline, before therapy. The FFAu level was an independent risk factor for death as early as at 1 day of hospitalization and continued to be an independent risk factor for the >3.8 years of follow-up. When adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors, the FFAu levels in the fourth versus the first quartile remained an independent risk factor for death from MI (hazard ratio 5.0, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 13.0), all cardiac death (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.4), and all-cause death (hazard ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.1). Women were twice as likely to be in the upper 2 FFAu quartiles and had approximately twice the rate of death as men. In conclusion, FFAu elevation is 1 of the earliest molecular biomarkers of mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation MI and was independent of other risk factors known to affect the outcomes after ST-segment elevation MI.

TI  - Impact of atrial fibrillation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (from the HORIZONS-AMI [Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction] trial).
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with worse outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and impact of new-onset AF after primary PCI in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial. HORIZONS-AMI was a large-scale, multicenter, international, randomized trial comparing different antithrombotic regimens and stents during primary PCI in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions. Three-year ischemic and bleeding end points were compared between patients with and without new-onset AF after PCI. Of the 3,602 patients included in the HORIZONS-AMI study, 3,281 (91.1%) with sinus rhythm at initial presentation had primary PCI as their primary management strategy. Of these, new-onset AF developed in 147 (4.5%). Compared with patients without AF after PCI, patients with new-onset AF had higher 3-year rates of net adverse clinical events (46.5% vs 25.7%, p<0.0001), mortality (11.9% vs 6.3%, p= 0.01), reinfarction (16.4% vs 7.0%, p <0.0001), stroke (5.8% vs 1.5%, p <0.0001), and major bleeding (20.9% vs 8.2%, p <0.0001). By multivariate analysis, new-onset AF after PCI was a powerful independent predictor of netadverse clinical events (hazard ratio 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 2.34, p=0.0002) and major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.36) at 3 years. In conclusion, new-onset AF after PCI for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was associated with markedly higher rates of adverse events and mortality.

TI  - Levosimendan may improve weaning outcomes in venoarterial ECMO patients.
AB  - Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) provides temporary mechanical circulatory support in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock, allowing time for cardiac recovery. Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer with inotropic and vasodilatory effects used in the treatment of severe heart failure. It does not increase myocardial oxygen consumption. Its maximum hemodynamic response is seen 24-48 h after stopping infusion, but its effects can persist for 7-9 d owing to active metabolites. We sought to investigate whether the use of levosimendan improves weaning outcomes in patients on VA-ECMO. Six consecutive patients with cardiogenic shock were placed on femorofemoral VA-ECMO support and received levosimendan 24 h before the planned weaning (group A). As control group (group B), we retrospectively reviewed the VA-ECMO implanted at our institution before the introduction of the levosimendan protocol. These patients received only traditional inotropes. The weaning rate was 83.33% in group A and 27.3% in group B. The survival rate was 66.66% and 36.4%, respectively. In group A, three of six patients (50%) required inotropic/vasopressor support after ECMO cessation, while in group B 11 of 11 patients (100%) required support. In our case series, pretreatment with levosimendan seems to facilitate weaning from VA-ECMO, reducing the need for high-dose inotropes.

TI  - Association between intraprocedural thrombotic events and adverse outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (a Harmonizing Outcomes With RevasculariZatiON and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction [HORIZONS-AMI] Substudy).
AB  - The present study sought to determine the extent to which adverse angiographic events encountered during percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Patients with STEMI represent a cohort at particularly high risk of intraprocedural thrombotic events (IPTEs). The overall frequency and implications of IPTEs occurring in patients with STEMI have not been systematically quantified in previous studies. A total of 3,163 patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation for STEMI in the Harmonizing Outcomes with RevasculariZatiON and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial underwent detailed frame-by-frame core laboratory angiographic analysis to assess IPTEs. The clinical outcomes at 30 days were compared between the patients with and without IPTEs. IPTEs, defined as the development of new or increasing thrombus, abrupt vessel closure, no reflow, slow reflow, and distal embolization at any point during the procedure, occurred in 386 patients (12.2%). The independent predictors of IPTE were thrombus at baseline, lesion length, and randomization to bivalirudin; the patients with IPTEs were also more likely to receive bailout glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and unplanned thrombectomy. Compared with patients without IPTEs, the patients with IPTEs had higher 30-day rates of composite major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, ischemic target vessel revascularization, and stroke; 7.8% vs 4.2%, p = 0.002), major bleeding not related to coronary artery bypass grafting (11.8% vs 6.5%, p <0.001), and all-cause death (4.2% vs 1.8%, p = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, IPTEs were independently associated with 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events, major bleeding, and death. In conclusion, the development of IPTEs in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI was associated with subsequent adverse outcomes, including major adverse cardiovascular events, major bleeding, and death. Additional studies of strategies to decrease the occurrence of IPTEs are warranted.

TI  - Target-attainment rates of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol using lipid-lowering drugs one year after acute myocardial infarction in sweden.
AB  - The objective of this prospective cohort study was to describe real-life use of lipid-lowering drugs and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target-attainment rates 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). LDL-C was recorded at hospital admission for AMI and at follow-up at 2 and 12 months after AMI in 17,236 patients in the Swedish heart registry, SWEDEHEART, from 2004 through 2009. Lipid-lowering treatments were identified using the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. More than 90% of patients received statins after AMI. Simvastatin 40 mg was used by 80% of patients at discharge and at 2 months and 68% at 1 year after AMI. Intensive statin therapy (LDL-C-lowering capacity >40%) was prescribed for 8.4%, 11.9%, and 12.2% at these time points, and combinations of statin/ezetimibe for 1.1%, 2.8%, and 5.0%, respectively. The LDL-C target of <2.5 mmol/L (97 mg/dl) was achieved in 74.5% of patients at 2 months and 72.3% at 12 months after AMI. Treatment was intensified for only 21.3% of patients with LDL-C above target at 2 months. In multivariate analysis, higher LDL-C levels at admission and at 2 months correlated to increased risk for under treatment at 12 months after AMI. In conclusion, statin treatment after AMI in Sweden has become standard, but titration to reach recommended LDL-C levels is still suboptimal. Strategies to further improve implementation of guidelines are needed.

TI  - New-onset atrial fibrillation after acute myocardial infarction and its relation to admission biomarkers (from the TRIUMPH registry).
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent predictor of mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We analyzed the relation between biomarkers linked to myocardial stretch (NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]), myocardial damage (Troponin-T [TnT]), and inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]) and new-onset AF during AMI to identify patients at high risk for AF. In a prospective multicenter registry of AMI patients (from the Translational Research Investigating Underlying disparities in recovery from acute Myocardial infarction: Patients' Health status registry), we measured NT-proBNP, TnT, and hs-CRP in patients without a history of AF (n = 2,370). New-onset AF was defined as AF that occurred during the index hospitalization. Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the association of biomarkers with new-onset AF, after adjusting for other covariates. New-onset AF was documented in 114 patients with AMI (4.8%; mean age 58 years; 32% women). For each twofold increase in NT-proBNP, there was an 18% increase in the rate of AF (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.35; p <0.02). Similarly, for every twofold increase in hs-CRP, there was a 15% increase in the rate of AF (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30; p = 0.02). TnT was not independently associated with new-onset AF (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; p = 0.3). NT-proBNP and hs-CRP were independently associated with new in-hospital AF after MI, in both men and women, irrespective of race. Our study suggests that markers of myocardial stretch and inflammation, but not the amount of myocardial necrosis, are important determinants of AF in the setting of AMI.

TI  - Opposite predictive value of pulse pressure and aortic pulse wave velocity on heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction: insights from an Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS) substudy.
AB  - Although hypertension contributes significantly to worsen cardiovascular risk, blood pressure increment in subjects with heart failure is paradoxically associated with lower risk. The objective was to determine whether pulse pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV) remain prognostic markers, independent of treatment in heart failure with reduced left ventricular function. The investigation involved 6632 patients of the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study. All subjects had acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and signs/symptoms of heart failure. Carotid-femoral PWV was measured in a subpopulation of 306 subjects. In the overall population, baseline mean arterial pressure <90 mm Hg was associated with higher all-cause death (hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.30]; P<0.05), whereas higher left ventricular ejection fraction or pulse pressure was associated with lower rates of all-cause death, cardiovascular death/hospitalization, and cardiovascular death. In the subpopulation, increased baseline PWV was associated with worse outcomes (all-cause death: 1.16 [1.03-1.30]; P<0.05 and cardiovascular deaths: 1.16 [1.03-1.31]; P<0.05), independent of age and left ventricular ejection fraction. Using multiple regression analysis, systolic blood pressure and age were the main independent factors positively associated with pulse pressure or PWV, both in the entire population or in the PWV substudy. In heart failure and low ejection fraction, our results suggest that pulse pressure, being negatively associated with outcome, is more dependent on left ventricular function and thereby no longer a marker of aortic elasticity. In contrast, increased aortic stiffness, assessed by PWV, contributes significantly to cardiovascular death.

AB  - The IFFANIAM study (Impact of frailty and functional status in elderly patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary angioplasty) is an observational multicenter registry to assess the impact of frailty and functional status on outcomes of elderly patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary angioplasty. STEMI patients age 75 years or older undergoing primary angioplasty will be extensively studied during admission in 4 tertiary care Hospitals in Spain, assessing their baseline functional status (Barthel index, Lawton-Brody index), frailty (Fried criteria, FRAIL scale [fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight]), comorbidities (Charlson index), nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form), and quality of life (Seattle Angina Questionnaire). Participants will be managed according current recommendations. The primary outcome will be the description of 1-year mortality, its causes, and associated factors. Secondary outcomes will be functional capacity and quality of life. Results will help to better understand the impact of frailty and functional ability on outcomes in elderly STEMI patients undergoing primary angioplasty, thus potentially contributing to improving their clinical management. Higher life expectancy has resulted in a large segment of elderly population and an increase in myocardial infarction in these patients. This calls attention to healthcare systems to focus on promoting methods to improve the clinical management of this population.

AB  - The clinical course and medical treatment of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are not well established, especially in patients with concomitant renal dysfunction. We performed a retrospective analysis of the prospective Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry to assess the medical treatments and clinical outcomes of patients with CHF (Killip classes II or III) complicated by AMI, in the presence or absence of renal dysfunction. Of 13,498 patients with AMI, 2769 (20.5%) had CHF on admission. Compared to CHF patients with preserved renal function, in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiac events were increased both at 1 month and at 1 year after discharge in patients with renal dysfunction (1154; 41.7%). Postdischarge use of aspirin, betablockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers and statins significantly reduced the 1-year mortality rate for CHF patients with renal dysfunction; such reduction was not observed for those without renal dysfunction, except in the case of aspirin. Patients with CHF complicating AMI, which is accompanied by renal dysfunction, are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes than patients without renal dysfunction. However, they receive fewer medications proven to reduce mortality rates.

TI  - Relation between white blood cell count and final infarct size in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (from the INFUSE AMI trial).
AB  - Although it has been shown that elevated white blood cell count (WBCc) on presentation is associated with an increased risk of cardiac mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the responsible mechanisms are unknown. We therefore sought to investigate whether elevated WBCc is associated with increased infarct size measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 30days after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in the Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients With Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction trial. INFUSE AMI randomized patients with STEMI and proximal or mid-left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion to bolus intracoronary abciximab versus no abciximab and to manual aspiration versus no aspiration. WBCc at hospital admission was available in 407 of 452 randomized patients. Patients were stratified according to tertiles of WBCc. At 30days, a significant stepwise increase in infarct size (percentage of total left ventricular mass) was apparent across tertiles of increasing WBCc (median [interquartile range] for tertiles I vs II vs III= 11.2% [3.8% to 19.6%] vs 17.5% [0.5% to 22.9%] vs 19.1% [13.7 to 26.0], respectively, p <0.0001). Absolute infarct mass in grams and abnormal wall motion score were also significantly increased across tertiles of WBC. By multivariate linear regression analysis, WBCc was an independent predictor of infarct size along with intracoronary abciximab randomization, age, time from symptom onset to first device, proximal left anterior descending location, and baseline TIMI flow of 0/1. In conclusion, in patients with anterior wall STEMI, an elevated admission WBCc is a powerful independent predictor of infarct size measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 30days after primary percutaneous coronary intervention.

TI  - Outcome after ST elevation myocardial infarction in patients with cancer treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention.
AB  - The simultaneous occurrence of cancer and coronary heart disease is increasing in the Western world. Nevertheless, the influence of cancer on ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been investigated extensively. This multicenter registry included patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI from 2006 to 2009. Patients were stratified according to history of cancer, and primary focus lay on all-cause and cardiac mortalities during 1-year follow-up. Adjusted effect sizes were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. In total, 208 patients had a history of cancer (diagnosed 6months ago in 20.7%, 6 months to 3 years ago in 21.7%, and >3years ago in 57.6%) and 3,215 patients had no history of cancer. Chemotherapy had been administered previously to 23% of patients with cancer. Patients with cancer were older, more frequently women, and more commonly known with previous myocardial infarction or anemia. Reperfusion rates were similar after PCI. Patients with cancer showed greater all-cause (17.4% vs 6.5% in other patients) and cardiac mortalities at 1 year (10.7% vs 5.4% in other patients) because of high early cardiac death (23.8%) in recently diagnosed patients with cancer. After adjustment, a recent cancer diagnosis predicted cardiac mortality at 7 days (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 7.08). The adverse prognosis was partly explained by anemia and occurrence of cardiogenic shock, whereas outcome was independent of cancer treatment. In conclusion, patients with cancer showed greater mortality after STEMI. A cancer diagnosis in the 6months before primary PCI was strongly associated with early cardiac mortality.

Although anaemia (based on the WHO definitions) does not appear to be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality or major adverse cardiac events after PPCI on multivariate analysis, there appears to be a threshold value of Hb among men, below which there is an associated increased risk for PPCI.

TI  - Utility of intra-aortic balloon pump support for ventricular septal rupture and acute mitral regurgitation complicating acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - Clinical data on optimal management of mechanical complications of myocardial infarction are lacking. We retrospectively evaluated the effect of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) on 30-day survival in patients with postinfarction ventricular septal rupture (VSR, n= 55) or acute mitral regurgitation (MR, n= 26) who developed either cardiogenic shock (n= 46) or severe hemodynamic instability that did not fulfill the criteria of shock (n= 35). IABP was inserted in 83% of the patients with shock and 57% of those without shock. Thirty-five (76%) patients with shock and all unstable patients survived until surgical repair, which was performed within a median (interquartile range) of 1 (1 to 2) and 9 (2 to 18) days from the onset of the complication (p <0.001). All patients who did not undergo the operation died within 3days. Although MR presented more acutely, the patients' outcomes were similar to those with VSR. IABP support reduced 30-day mortality in the patients with shock (61% vs 100%, p= 0.04) but not in the patients without shock (20% vs 27%, p= 0.7). The benefit of IABP support in the shock cohort was driven mainly by reduction of preoperative mortality (11% vs 88%, p <0.001). Early progression of cardiogenic shock and unperformed surgery were the only independent predictors of 30-day mortality (hazard ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 8 and hazard ratio 5.1, 95% confidence interval 2.2 to 11, respectively; p= 0.004 and p <0.001, respectively). In conclusion, we suggest that all patients with postinfarction VSR or acute MR with signs of cardiogenic shock should immediately receive IABP as a bridge to emergent surgical repair. In contrast, hemodynamically unstable patients without shock may be first stabilized by medical therapy, without additional benefit of IABP, before they undergo cardiac surgery.

TI  - Effects of valsartan versus amlodipine in diabetic hypertensive patients with or without previous cardiovascular disease.
AB  - Recently, we reported that angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), valsartan, and calcium channel blocker (CCB), amlodipine, had similar effects on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in diabetic hypertensive patients. We assessed the difference of cardiovascular protective effects between ARB and CCB in patients with and without previous CVD, respectively. A total of 1,150 Japanese diabetic hypertensive patients were randomized to either valsartan or amlodipine treatment arms, which were additionally divided into 2 groups according to the presence of previous CVD at baseline (without CVD, n= 818; with CVD, n= 332). The primary composite outcomes were sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure. The incidence of primary end point events in patients with previous CVD was 3.5-times greater than that in patients without previous CVD (64.1 vs 17.9/1,000 person-years). The ARB- and the CCB-based treatment arms showed similar incidence of composite CVD events in both patients without previous CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 2.40) and those with previous CVD (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.31). The ARB-treatment arm showed less incidence of stroke compared with the CCB-based treatment arm in patients with previous CVD (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.11, p= 0.068), whereas the 2 treatment arms showed similar incidence of stroke in patients without previous CVD (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.91). In conclusion, the ARB- and the CCB-based treatments exerted similar protective effects of CVD events regardless of the presence of previous CVD. For stroke events, the ARB may have more protective effects than the CCB in diabetic hypertensive patients with previous CVD.

TI  - Comparison of the reperfusion efficacy of thrombus aspiration with and without distal protection during primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.
AB  - We evaluated a hypothesis that thrombus aspiration with distal protection is superior to simple thrombus aspiration in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 176 consecutive patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were enrolled in this study and assigned to either the thrombus aspiration group (A, n= 104) or the thrombus aspiration with distal protection group using a filter device system (A+ DP, n= 72). We compared the angiographic reperfusion grade, left ventricular (LV) function, and clinical outcomes between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in age, gender distribution, the onset-to-reperfusion time, the peak levels of creatine kinase, or 6-month mortality between the 2 groups. The rate of achieving a Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade of 3 and a myocardial blush grade of 3 was higher in the A+ DP group than in the A group. Among the patients who underwent follow-up catheterization 6 months after PCI (A, n= 62; A+ DP, n= 52), there were no significant differences in the LV end-diastolic volume index, LV end-systolic volume index, or LV ejection fraction between the 2 groups at the time of PCI or 6 months after PCI. In conclusion, thrombus aspiration with distal protection may be more effective in initially restoring the coronary blood flow than thrombus aspiration alone, although it may not be superior to thrombus aspiration in preventing LV remodeling or preserving the LV function in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

TI  - Postconditioning attenuates no-reflow in STEMI patients.
AB  - After acute myocardial infarction, the presence of no-reflow (or microvascular obstruction: MVO) has been associated with adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and worse clinical outcome. This study examined the effects of mechanical ischemic postconditioning on early and late MVO size in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Fifty patients undergoing primary coronary angioplasty for a first STEMI with TIMI grade flow 0-1 and no collaterals were randomized to ischemic postconditioning (PC) (n = 25) or control (n = 25) groups. Ischemic PC consisted in the application of four consecutive cycles of a 1-min balloon occlusion, each followed by a 1-min deflation at the onset of reperfusion. Early (3 min post-contrast) and late (10 min post-contrast) MVO size were assessed by contrast-enhanced cardiac-MRI within 96 h after reperfusion. PC was associated with smaller early and late MVO size (3.9  4.8 in PC versus 7.8  6.6% of LV in controls for early MVO, P = 0.02; and 1.8  3.1 in PC versus 4.1  3.9% of LV in controls for late MVO; P = 0.01). This significant reduction was persistent after adjustment for thrombus aspiration, which neither had any significant effect on infarct size, nor on early or late MVO (P = NS for all). Attenuation of MVO was associated to infarct size reduction. Mechanical postconditioning significantly reduces MVO in patients with acute STEMI treated with primary angioplasty.

TI  - Impact of the severity of coronary artery calcification on clinical events in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (from the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy Trial).
AB  - The treatment of calcified coronary lesions by percutaneous coronary intervention has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes and an increased rate of complications. However, the impact of coronary calcification in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unknown. A total of 755 patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome in the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy trial underwent CABG. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the presence and extent of coronary calcifications (lesion level: severe, moderate, none to mild) as assessed by an independent angiographic core laboratory. Major ischemic and bleeding outcomes were assessed at 30days and 1year. Severe calcification was found in 103 patients (13.6%), moderate calcification in 249 patients (33.0%), and none-to-mild calcification in 403 patients (53.4%). The presence of severe calcification compared with moderate or none to mild was associated with a significantly higher unadjusted rate of death (11.8% vs 3.7% vs 4.5%, p= 0.006), death or myocardial infarction (MI; 31.1% vs 19.7% vs 16.4%, p= 0.006), and major adverse cardiac event (MACE; 32.0% vs 22.6% vs 20.8%, p= 0.059) at 1year. By multivariate analysis, severe calcification (vs nonsevere calcification) was identified as an independent predictor of 1-year MACE (hazard ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.21, p= 0.04) and death or MI (hazard ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.66, p= 0.006). In conclusion, the presence of severe coronary calcification was associated with worse outcomes after CABG, including an increased risk of death. The presence of severe coronary calcification was identified as an independent predictor of MACE and death or MI 1year after CABG.

AB  - Intravenous enoxaparin did not reduce significantly the primary end point (p = 0.06) compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the randomized Acute Myocardial Infarction Treated with primary angioplasty and intravenous enoxaparin Or unfractionated heparin to Lower ischemic and bleeding events at short- and Long-term follow-up (ATOLL) trial. We present the results of the prespecified per-protocol analysis excluding patients who did not receive the treatment allocated by randomization or received both enoxaparin and UFH. We evaluated all-cause mortality, complication of myocardial infarction, procedural failure, or major bleeding (primary end point) and all-cause mortality, recurrent acute coronary syndrome, or urgent revascularization (main secondary end point). Baseline and procedural characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups. Of 910 randomized patients, 795 patients (87.4%) were treated according to the protocol with consistent anticoagulation using intravenous enoxaparin (n = 400) or UFH (n = 395). Enoxaparin reduced significantly the rates of the primary end point (relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62 to 0.94, p = 0.012) and the main secondary end point (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.63, p <0.0001). There was less major bleeding with enoxaparin (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01, p = 0.050) contributing to the significant improvement of the net clinical benefit (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.74, p = 0.0002). All-cause mortality was also reduced with enoxaparin (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74, p = 0.003). In conclusion, in the per-protocol analysis of the ATOLL trial, pertinent to >87% of the study population, enoxaparin was superior to UFH in reducing ischemic end points and mortality.

TI  - Intramyocardial injection of autologous bone marrow-derived ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stem cells in acute myocardial infarction patients is feasible and safe up to 5 years of follow-up.
AB  - In experimental studies, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) models has been associated with enhanced neovascularization and myogenesis. Clinical data however, are scarce. Therefore, the present study evaluates the safety and feasibility of intramyocardial MSC injection in nine patients, shortly after AMI during short-term and 5-year follow-up. Periprocedural safety analysis demonstrated one transient ischemic attack. No other adverse events related to MSC treatment were observed during 5-year follow-up. Clinical events were compared to a nonrandomized control group comprising 45 matched controls. A 5-year event-free survival after MSC-treatment was comparable to controls (89 vs. 91%, P=0.87). Echocardiographic imaging for evaluation of left ventricular function demonstrated improvements up to 5years after MSC treatment. These findings were not significantly different when compared to controls. The present safety and feasibility study suggest that intramyocardial injection of MSC in patients shortly after AMI is feasible and safe up to 5-year follow-up.

TI  - Quantitative point-of-care troponin T measurement for diagnosis and prognosis in patients with a suspected acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - Improvement of prehospital triage is essential to ensure rapid management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study evaluates the feasibility of prehospital quantitative point-of-care cardiac troponin T (POC-cTnT) analysis, its ability to identify patients with AMI, and its capacity to predict mortality. The study was performed in the Central Denmark Region from May 2010 to May 2011. As a supplement to electrocardiography, a prehospital POC-cTnT measurement was performed by a paramedic in patients with suspected AMI. AMI was diagnosed according to the universal definition of myocardial infarction using the ninety-ninth percentile upper reference level as diagnostic cut point. The paramedics performed POC-cTnT measurements in 985 subjects with a symptom duration of 70 minutes (95% CI, 35 to 180); of whom, 200 (20%) had an AMI. The prehospital sample was obtained 88 minutes (range, 58 to 131) before the sample made on admission to the hospital. The sensitivity for detection of patients with an AMI was 39% (95% CI, 32% to 46%) and the diagnostic accuracy of the POC-cTnT values was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.71). Adjusted survival analysis showed a strong significant association between elevated prehospital POC-cTnT level above the detection level of 50 ng/L and mortality in patients with a suspected AMI irrespective of whether an AMI was diagnosed. In conclusion, large-scale quantitative prehospital POC-cTnT testing by paramedics is feasible. An elevated prehospital POC-cTnT value contains diagnostic information and is highly predictive of mortality in patients with a suspected AMI.

TI  - In-hospital major bleeding and its clinical relevance in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention.
AB  - Advances in antithrombotic therapy for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) enhance the risk of bleeding. Therefore, the incidence, determinants, and prognostic implications of in-hospital major bleeding after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI were investigated. In 963 consecutive patients, the incidence of bleeding was evaluated according to commonly used classifications including Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress Adverse outcomes with Early implementation of the ACC/AHA guidelines, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction, Global Use of Strategies To Open coronary arteries, and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium. Multivariate regression analyses investigated determinants of bleeding and the relation between bleeding and 1-year all-cause mortality. Large variability in incidence existed depending on classification (1.3% to 21%). Female gender, heart rate, creatinine, multivessel disease, cardiogenic shock, and procedural failure were independently associated with bleeding. One-year mortality reached 10.2% in bleeders versus 2.0% in nonbleeders (p <0.001). Bleeding was independently associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.41, p <0.017). Assessment of individual classifications confirmed the increased risk of mortality for Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (HR 2.27, p = 0.048), but not for Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress Adverse outcomes with Early implementation of the ACC/AHA guidelines, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction, and Global Use of Strategies To Open coronary arteries bleeding. Thrombotic events occurred more frequently in bleeders (5.8% vs 1.5%, p <0.001); however, bleeding remained independently related to mortality with a negligible reduction in HR (2.25, p = 0.028) after adjustment. In conclusion, in-hospital major bleeding was frequently observed after STEMI, but a widespread variation in incidence existed depending on the applied definition. Patient and procedural characteristics were related to bleeding, allowing identification of high-risk patients. In-hospital major bleeding was independently associated with 1-year all-cause mortality; however, not all bleeding classifications proved equally relevant to prognosis. The relation between bleeding and mortality was shown not to be driven by the higher rate of thrombotic events among bleeders.

TI  - [LINKOR: results of observational program in patients with myocardial infarction].
AB  - The results of Assessment Program effective treatment of patients with myocardiaL INfarction drug ProCORalan (ivabradine) in outpatient practice, conducted in 53 cities of the Russian Federation, 333 doctors. Included 1226 patients (822 men and 404 women, average age 60,1+/-9,3 years). Despite treatment, before inclusion in the patients maintained an average 8,17+/-8,60 (mediana 6) angina attacks per week, elevated blood pressure (141,8+/-20,3/86,2+/-11,6 mm Hg) and heart rate (84,5 +/-10,4 beats / min). Adding to ivabradine treatment for 16 weeks resulted in significant (p<0.00001) reduction in heart rate (up to 63,1+/-7,5 beats / min), the number of angina attacks per week (from 8.17 to 1.27) and need for nitroglycerin (from 7.69 to 0.89 tablets per week). Decreased the number of patients that called ambulance assistance (from 35.6 to 1.5%), and hospitalization (from 15.4 to 1.2%). There was a significant (p<0.00001) increase in evaluating the effectiveness of treatment (from 5,4+/-1,8 to 8,9 +/-1,3 points), reducing the risk stratification of patients (6,1+/-1,5 to 4 3+/-2,0 points), increased stability evaluation of state (from 5,6+/-1,9 to 3,7+/-2,2 points) and improved assessment of prognosis (from 5,7+/-2,0 to 3,6 +/-1,9 points). Expressed significantly positive effects observed after 1 month of therapy, after the effect became more pronounced. Significantly improved quality of life estimated by Seattle Angina Questionnaire and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure. The maximum recommended dose ivabradine of 15mg/day were given 50% of the patients, the dose of 10 mg/day - 28%. Adverse effects were reported in 3.3% of patients, of which, according to doctors associated with taking the drug - 0.82%. During follow up, 4 patients died. Thus, the addition of ivabradine to -blocker therapy, persons with a history of myocardial infarction and angina experiencing elevated heart rate, are the tactics of a rational and safe therapy.

TI  - Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and its genetic determinants in relation to incident myocardial infarction and stroke in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (EPIC)-Germany study.
AB  - Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) has been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in observational studies. Also, SNPs to explain variation in 25(OH)D have been identified by genome-wide association studies. Detection of direct associations between SNPs that significantly affect 25(OH)D and CVD risk would indicate a causal role of vitamin D, as reverse causation could be excluded and confounding could be better controlled. Thus, a combined analysis of candidate SNPs in relation to circulating 25(OH)D and CVD risk was carried out. A case-cohort study within the EPIC-Germany study was conducted comprising a randomly drawn subcohort of 2,132 subjects (57.9% women, mean age: 50.6 years) and incident cases of myocardial infarction (n=559) and stroke (n=471) that occurred during a mean follow-up duration of 7.6 years. 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS in baseline plasma samples. Additionally, eight candidate SNPs were assayed. Associations between 25(OH)D, SNPs and the risks of myocardial infarction and stroke were assessed by multivariable regression analyses. Mean 25(OH)D level was 47.2 nmol/L in the subcohort. Four SNPs were associated with 25(OH)D (p<0.05). In subjects with 25(OH)D levels <25 nmol/L, the risks of CVD as composite endpoint (Hazard Ratio: 1.53, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-2.09), myocardial infarction, and stroke were significantly increased compared to subjects with levels  50 nmol/L, while no significant linear associations were observed. A SNP score was not related to the risks of total CVD (Hazard Ratio: 1.0, 95% confidence interval: 0.71-1.42), myocardial infarction, or stroke. The same was true concerning single SNPs. Given the lack of association between SNPs and the risks of stroke and myocardial infarction, the present findings do not point to a major causal role of vitamin D in the development of these diseases. However, a detection of modest associations between genetic markers and CVD risk in larger consortia cannot be ruled out.

TI  - Correlation between D-dimer levels and coronary artery reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction patients after thrombolytic treatment.
AB  - The correlation between plasma D-dimer level and reperfusion has not been clarified yet in thrombolytic therapy applied for acute myocardial infarction patients. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a relationship between reperfusion and fibrinolytic activity in acute myocardial infarction patients treated with thrombolytic therapy. Fibrinolytic activity was reflected by plasma D-dimer levels. During the study period, 186 patients were initially analyzed. But 18 of these patients were excluded from the study because they were not suitable for study criteria. Blood was collected from 168 acute myocardial infarction patients within first 6 h. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (100 mg) or streptokinase (1,500,000 U) was applied to patients. Mean age of the patients was 58 (28-86) years and majority was men (86%). The number of anterior, inferior, and lateral myocardial infarction patients were 76 (45.2%), 85 (50.6%), and seven (4.2%), respectively. The mean time from symptom onset to thrombolytic application was 134 (95-212) min. Reperfusion occurred in 115 (68.5%) patients. D-dimer levels were markedly high after thrombolytic therapy versus before (155 mg/dl, 362 mg/dl, P<0.005). We compared the D-dimer values before and after thrombolytic therapy between reperfused group and the nonreperfused group (189-409 mg/l in reperfused group, P=0.086; 82-258 mg/l in the nonreperfused group, P=0.173). In conclusion, in this study, D-dimer levels were elevated markedly in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction after thrombolytic therapy, but no significant difference was seen in D-dimer levels between the reperfused and nonreperfused groups.

TI  - Impact of hypertension on distal embolization, myocardial perfusion, and mortality in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary angioplasty.
AB  - Hypertension is a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis. However, data on the impact of hypertension in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are inconsistent and mainly related to studies performed in the thrombolytic era, with very few data on patients undergoing primary angioplasty. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of hypertension on distal embolization, myocardial perfusion, and mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Our population is represented by 1,662 patients undergoing primary angioplasty for STEMI included in the Early Glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors in Primary angioplasty database. Myocardial perfusion was evaluated by myocardial blush grade and ST segment resolution. Follow-up data were collected within 1 year after primary angioplasty. Hypertension was observed in 700 patients (42.1%). Hypertension was associated with more advanced age (p<0.001), female gender (p <0.001), diabetes (p <0.001), hypercholesterolemia (p <0.001), previous revascularization (p <0.001), anterior myocardial infarction (p= 0.006), longer ischemia time (p= 0.03), more extensive coronary artery disease (p= 0.002), more often treated with abciximab (p <0.001), and less often smokers (p <0.001). Hypertension was associated with impaired postprocedural myocardial blush grade 2 to 3 (68.2% vs 74.2%, p= 0.019) and complete ST segment resolution (51.7% vs 61.1%, p= 0.001). By a mean follow-up of 206  158 days, 70 patients (4.3%) had died. Hypertension was associated with a greater mortality (6.2% vs 2.9%, hazard ratio 2.31, 95% confidence interval 1.42 to 3.73, p<0.001), confirmed after correction for baseline confounding factors (hazard ratio 1.82, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 3.22, p <0.001). In conclusion, this study showed that among patients with STEMI undergoing primary angioplasty, hypertension is associated with impaired reperfusion and independently predicts 1-year mortality.

AB  - Despite recent therapeutic advances, significant residual risk for in-hospital mortality persists among patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), a known independent predictor of increased cardiovascular events, may be an important modulator of heightened risk after acute MI. We evaluated admission HDL-C levels among 98,276 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with acute MI from the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines (ACTION Registry-GWTG) program who were enrolled from 490 United States hospitals from January 2007 to December 2010. Clinical characteristics, treatments, atherosclerotic burden, and in-hospital outcomes were analyzed by quartiles of admission HDL-C (Q1: 10 to 30 mg/dl; Q2: 30.1 to 36.9 mg/dl; Q3: 37 to 45 mg/dl; and Q4: 45.1 to 100 mg/dl). Logistic regression was used to explore the relation among HDL-C quartiles, coronary artery disease severity, and in-hospital mortality. Almost half of the patients with acute MI had low admission levels of HDL-C (less than the median 36.9 mg/dl). Such patients were younger, more often men, white, obese, diabetic, smokers, and had higher rates of previous cardiovascular events. After multivariate adjustment, patients with low HDL-C levels had greater extent of severe angiographic multivessel coronary narrowings and higher mortality. Among the 26% of patients in the lowest HDL-C quartile (30 mg/dl), there was a 16% greater risk of in-hospital mortality compared with patients in the highest HDL-C quartile (p= 0.012). In conclusion, low levels of HDL-C were common in patients admitted with acute MI and were associated with more extensive angiographic coronary disease. Very low levels of admission HDL-C were observed in one-quarter of patients and associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality.

TI  - Relation between preoperative renal dysfunction and cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure or death) within three months of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting.
AB  - Renal dysfunction is related to long-term mortality and myocardial infarction after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We aimed to investigate the association between preoperative renal dysfunction and early risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure after CABG. From the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies registry, we included all 36,284 patients who underwent primary isolated CABG from 2000 to 2008 in Sweden. The Swedish National Inpatient Registry was used to obtain the primary end point, which was rehospitalization for stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure 90 days after CABG. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk for the primary outcome and the secondary outcome of death from any cause, while adjusting for confounders. During 90 days of follow-up, there were 2,462 cardiovascular events and 617 deaths. In total, 17% of patients developed acute kidney injury postoperatively. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for cardiovascular events after adjustment for age, gender, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke was 1.24 (1.06 to 1.45) in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) but became nonsignificant after acute kidney injury was introduced into the statistical model. The risk of death was significantly increased in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.38 to 2.25) even after adjustment for all confounders. Renal dysfunction was associated with all-cause mortality but not with cardiovascular events during the first 3 postoperative months after primary isolated CABG.

TI  - Trends in acute kidney injury and outcomes after early percutaneous coronary intervention in patients 75 years of age with acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2002 to 2010 to examine the temporal trends in incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), AKI requiring dialysis, and associated in-hospital mortality in patients 75 years of age hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction and undergoing early (within 24 hours) percutaneous coronary intervention. Of 2,225,707 patients 75 years of age with acute myocardial infarction, 233,508 (10.5%) underwent early percutaneous coronary intervention, of which 21,961 (9.4%) developed AKI and 1,257 (0.54%) developed AKI requiring dialysis. From 2002 to 2010, the incidence of AKI increased from 5.6% to 14.2% (p for trend <0.001) and that for AKI requiring dialysis decreased (0.6% to 0.4%; p for trend 0.018). Compared with 2002, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for AKI, AKI requiring dialysis, and in-hospital mortality in 2010 were 1.87 (1.71 to 2.05), 0.20 (0.15 to 0.27) and 0.74 (0.60 to 0.90), respectively. In conclusion, among hospitalized adults 75 years of age, from 2002 to 2010, there was an increase in AKI, but there was paradoxical decrease in AKI requiring dialysis and in-hospital mortality, potentially reflecting increased health-care provider awareness resulting in early recognition and implementation of renal-protective strategies and diagnosis-related group creep.

TI  - Comparison of different electrocardiographic scoring systems for detection of any previous myocardial infarction as assessed with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.
AB  - Although electrocardiography is frequently used as an initial test to detect or rule out previous myocardial infarction (MI), the diagnostic performance of commonly used electrocardiographic scoring systems is not well described. We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of (1) the Universal Definition, (2) Minnesota ECG Code (MC), (3) Selvester QRS Score, and (4) assessment by cardiologists using late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard. Additionally, the effect of electrocardiographic patterns and infarct characteristics on detecting previous MI was evaluated. The 3-month follow-up electrocardiograms of 78 patients with first-time reperfused ST elevation MI were pooled with electrocardiograms of 36 healthy controls. All 114 electrocardiograms were randomly analyzed, blinded to clinical and LGE-CMR data. The sensitivity of the Universal Definition, MC, Selvester QRS Score, and cardiologists todetect previous MI was 33%, 79%, 90%, and 67%, respectively; specificity 97%, 72%, 31%, and 89%, respectively; diagnostic accuracy 54%, 77%, 71%, and 74%, respectively. Probability of detecting MI by cardiologists increased with an increasing number (odds ratio [OR] 2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30 to 3.09), width (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03), and depth (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.27) of Q waves as well as increasing infarct size (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25) and transmurality (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08; p <0.05 for all). The time-consuming MC and rapid visual assessment by cardiologists achieved the best and similar diagnostic accuracies to detect previous MI. The diagnostic performance of all 4 electrocardiographic scoring systems was modest and related to the number, depth, and width of Q waves as well as increasing infarct size and transmurality. In conclusion, the exclusion of a previous MI based solely on electrocardiographic findings should be done with caution. Future studies are needed to define which patients should be referred to additional diagnostic testing.

TI  - Implications of myocardial reperfusion on survival in women versus men with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary coronary intervention.
AB  - We evaluated the effects of myocardial perfusion after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on gender-based mortality rates. Research has demonstrated a gender-specific response of cardiomyocytes to ischemia and a potential increase in myocardial salvage in women compared with men. Myocardial blush grade (MBG), an angiographic surrogate of myocardial perfusion, is an independent predictor of early and late survival after AMI. Whether the incidence and prognosis of myocardial perfusion differs according to gender among patients with AMI undergoing PCI is unknown. MBG and short- and long-term mortality were evaluated in 1,301 patients (male= 935; female= 366) with AMI randomized to primary angioplasty  abciximab versus stent  abciximab. Following PCI, >96% of patients achieved final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 flow, of which MBG 2/3 was present in 58.3% of women versus 51.1% of men (p= 0.02). Worse MBG was an independent predictor of mortality in women at 30 days (7.4% for MBG 0/1 vs 2.4% for MBG 2/3, p= 0.04) and at 1-year (11.0% for MBG 0/1 vs 3.4% for MBG 2/3, p= 0.01); however, MBG was not associated with differences in mortality for men. In conclusion, impaired myocardial perfusion following PCI for AMI, indicated by worse MBG, is an independent predictor of early and late mortality in women but not in men. These findings imply an enhanced survival benefit from restoring myocardial perfusion for women compared with men during primary angioplasty and may have clinical implications for interventional strategies in women.

TI  - Impact of the introduction of drug eluting stents on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous and surgical coronary artery revascularisation procedures in Western Australia.
AB  - The introduction of drug eluting stents and resulting changes in coronary revascularisation strategies were not associated with changes in the one-year risk of major clinical endpoints (death or death/MI), but were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of MACE, driven entirely by a reduction in TVR after PCI. This real world study supports the effectiveness of drug eluting stents in reducing repeat procedures in the total CARP population without increasing the risk of death or MI.

TI  - Impact of scheduled angiographic follow-up in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.
AB  - Routine scheduled angiographic follow-up (SAF) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been associated with a higher rate of target vessel revascularization (TVR). Its benefits are not known. SAF at 13 months after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was planned in the first 1,800 successfully stented patients enrolled in the Harmonizing Outcomes with RevascularIZatiON and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial. We compared the outcomes of patients with and without SAF at 1 year (before SAF) and at 3 years (after SAF). There were 1,197 patients (66.5% of expected) with and 2,207 patients without SAF. Prior to SAF, the 1-year composite rate of death or myocardial infarction (MI) was not significantly different between the 2 groups (2.7% vs. 3.9%, respectively, P=0.06), although the rate of death was lower (0.1% vs. 2.2%, P<0.0001), nor were there differences in the 1-year rates of TVR, stent thrombosis or major adverse cardiac and cerebral events). At 3 years, death or MI rates were again similar between the groups (8.3% vs. 9.5%, P=0.22), but TVR was more common in the SAF group (17.0% vs. 8.6%, P<0.0001), due to an increase in TVR at time of SAF. In the SAF group, patients in whom TVR was performed before or after the 13-month SAF window had markedly higher 3-year rates of MI and stent thrombosis than patients in whom TVR was performed during SAF or not at all. In conclusion, SAF after primary PCI in STEMI is associated with doubling of the rate of revascularization without an improvement in death or MI, and therefore cannot be recommended.

TI  - Does mobilisation of CD34+ stem cells along with VEGF, angiogenin, IL-6, IL-8, and hsCRP levels allow predicting the direction of left ventricular ejection fraction and wall motion score index changes in patients with myocardial infarction?
AB  - 1. Evaluation of plasma VEGF, angiogenin, IL-6, IL-8, and hsCRP levels and the number of CD34+ cells at different time points in patients with STEMI did not allow predicting the direction of changes in LVEF and WMSI. 2. Observed significant correlations between hsCRP level and LVEF and WMSI may suggest a harmful effect of inflammation on postinfarction myocardial remodelling. 3. A significant negative correlation between the number of CD34+ and WMSI suggests that increased mobilisation of these cells might have a beneficial effect on systolic function after MI.

TI  - Health-related quality-of-life after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with UA/NSTEMI and STEMI: the Korean multicenter registry.
AB  - Compared with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), long-term outcomes are known to be worse in patients with unstable angina/non-STEMI (UA/NSTEMI), which might be related to the worse health status of patients with UA/STEMI. In patients with UA/NSTEMI and STEMI underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), angina-specific and general health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) was investigated at baseline and at 30 days after PCI. Patients with UA/NSTEMI were older and had higher frequencies in female, diabetes and hypertension. After PCI, both angina-specific and general HRQOL scores were improved, but improvement was much more frequent in angina-related HRQOL of patients with UA/NSTEMI than those with STEMI (44.2% vs 36.8%, P < 0.001). Improvement was less common in general HRQOL. At 30-days after PCI, angina-specific HRQOL of the patients with UA/NSTEMI was comparable to those with STEMI (56.1  18.6 vs 56.6  18.7, P = 0.521), but general HRQOL was significantly lower (0.86  0.21 vs 0.89  0.17, P = 0.001) after adjusting baseline characteristics (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the general health status of those with UA/NSTEMI was not good even after optimal PCI. In addition to angina-specific therapy, comprehensive supportive care would be needed to improve the general health status of acute coronary syndrome survivors.

TI  - Importance of total ischemic time and preprocedural infarct-related artery blood flow in predicting infarct size in patients with anterior wall myocardial infarction (from the CRISP-AMI Trial).
AB  - The goal of this study was to characterize determinants of infarct size in the multicenter randomized Counterpulsation to Reduce Infarct Size Pre-PCI Acute Myocardial Infarction (CRISP-AMI) trial. Contemporary determinants of infarct size in patients presenting with acute anterior myocardial infarction without shock and undergoing percutaneous revascularization have been incompletely characterized. In CRISP-AMI, 337 patients with acute anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction but without cardiogenic shock at 30 sites in 9 countries were randomized to initiation of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation before primary percutaneous coronary intervention versus standard of care. The primary outcome was infarct size as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 3 to 5 days after percutaneous coronary intervention. Of 337 randomized patients, complete periprocedural and infarct size data were available in 250 patients (74%). After a comparison of baseline characteristics to ensure no significant differences, patients with missing data were excluded. Using multiple linear regression of 23 variables, time from symptom onset to first device ( = 0.022, p = 0.047) and preprocedural Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 0/1 ( = 15.28, p <0.001) were independent predictors of infarct size. Infarct size increased by 0.43% per 30 minutes in early reperfusion and by 0.63% every 30 minutes in late reperfusion. In conclusion, in patients with acute anterior ST elevation myocardial infraction without cardiogenic shock, total ischemic time and preprocedural Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 0/1 were associated with increased infarct size as determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. These findings underscore the importance of systems of care aimed at reducing total ischemic time to open infarct arteries.

AB  - Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor that was recently reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration as a potential therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Approval of this drug would represent a paradigm shift away from dual antiplatelet therapy toward long-term triple antithrombotic therapy. However, to date, no other experimental anticoagulant agent has demonstrated a favorable risk-benefit profile in this population, in part because of the expected increased risk in major bleeding by combining aspirin, a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, and an anticoagulant. Approvability of rivaroxaban was considered largely on the basis of the ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 (Anti-Xa Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy in Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndrome ACS 2-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 51) trial, which demonstrated a significant reduction in a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Although the primary efficacy endpoint was met, a substantial amount of missing data was observed. We discuss the impact of missing data in this trial, its implications for informative censoring of safety events (major bleeding), and implications for future cardiovascular outcomes trials.

TI  - Incidence and outcome of high on-treatment platelet reactivity in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (from the VIP [VerifyNow and Inhibition of Platelet Reactivity] study).
AB  - High residual platelet reactivity (RPR) on clopidogrel treatment has been associated with increased risk for ischemic events during follow-up in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence, predictors, and clinical consequences of high RPR in a large population of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting. Overall, 833 patients received point-of-care testing of platelet inhibition 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention. High RPR was diagnosed on the basis of P2Y reaction units >230. The incidence and predictors of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and serious bleeding events were assessed up to 1 year from the day of testing. P2Y reaction units were normally distributed, and 264 patients were classified as poor responders (31.7%). Independent predictors of response to clopidogrel were male gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.51), age (OR 0.96), diabetes mellitus (OR 0.51), and use of proton pump inhibitors (OR 0.59). At 1 year, poor responders showed higher rates of death (4.6% vs 1.9%, p = 0.032) and serious bleeding events (4.9% vs 1.8%, p = 0.009) compared with good responders. After adjustment for confounders, high RPR did not emerge as an independent predictor of mortality (OR 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23 to 1.42, p = 0.23) or serious bleeding events (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.52, p = 0.29). The results did not change using the a cut-off value for P2Y reaction units of 208. In conclusion, 1/3 of patients with acute coronary syndromes who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting showed high on-treatment RPR on bedside monitoring. They had a worse prognosis, but the level of platelet inhibition was not independently associated with the incidence of ischemic or bleeding events.

TI  - Impact of bivalirudin and paclitaxel-eluting stents on outcomes in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending artery.
AB  - Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) are at increased risk for cardiovascular events compared with patients undergoing non-LAD PCI. We assessed the impact of bivalirudin and paclitaxel-eluting stenting (PES) in patients with STEMI who underwent LAD PCI. In the HORIZONS-AMI trial, 1,445 patients had LAD PCI and 1,884 patients had non-LAD PCI. The 3-year composite rates of death, reinfarction, stroke, or ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization were significantly higher in patients who underwent LAD PCI compared with non-LAD PCI (24.0% vs 20.6%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.39, p = 0.013), driven by a statistically significant increase in cardiac death (5.4% vs 2.7%, HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.86, p = 0.001). For patients who underwent LAD PCI, treatment with bivalirudin resulted in significantly lower rates of cardiac death (3.8% vs 6.8%, HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89, p = 0.01), reinfarction (5.3% vs 9.5%, HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83, p = 0.004), and major bleeding events (7.3% vs 11.8%, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.86, p = 0.004) compared with unfractionated heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Randomization to PES compared with bare-metal stenting resulted in a significant lower rate of target vessel revascularization (13.2% vs 19.8%, HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86, p = 0.003) with no significant differences in stent thrombosis, reinfarction, or death. In conclusion, in patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI of LAD, the use of bivalirudin was associated with a reduction in mortality and bleeding rates at 3 years. PES reduced revascularization rates in this population but did not have a significant impact on mortality.

TI  - [Soluble selectins in myocardial infarction].
AB  - The sE-selectin level increases with the severity of atherogenic changes in serum lipid profil, and sP-selectin level increases due to inflammatory and prothrombotic processes. The sL-selectin level is influenced by inflamamatory processes in the vascular wall. The sE- and sP-selectin levels, unchanged compared to the control group, do not reflect adequately the degree of endothelial activation. An decreased sL-selectin level may indicate functional depletion of leukocytes in patients with myocardial infarction and make it difficult to assess the degree of leukocytes stimulation.

TI  - Long-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion (from the CREDO-Kyoto registry cohort-2).
AB  - Despite improving success rate of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) lesions, the clinical benefit of recanalization of CTO is still a matter of debate. Of 13,087 patients who underwent PCI in the CREDO-Kyoto registry cohort-2, 1,524 patients received PCI for CTO (CTO-PCI). Clinical outcomes were compared between 1,192 patients with successful CTO-PCI and 332 patients with failed CTO-PCI. In-hospital death tended to occur less frequently in the successful CTO-PCI group than in the failed CTO-PCI group (1.4% vs 3.0%, p = 0.053). Through 3-year follow-up, the cumulative incidence of all-cause death was not significantly different between the successful and failed CTO-PCI groups (9.0% vs 13.1%, p = 0.18), whereas the cumulative incidence of cardiac death was significantly less in the successful CTO-PCI group than in the failed CTO-PCI group (4.5% vs 8.4%, p = 0.03). However, after adjusting confounders, successful CTO-PCI was associated with lesser risk for neither all-cause death (hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.37, p = 0.69) nor cardiac death (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.16, p = 0.16). The cumulative incidence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was remarkably less in patients with successful PCI compared with those with failed PCI (1.8% vs 19.6%, p <0.0001). In conclusion, successful CTO-PCI compared with failed PCI was not associated with lesser risk for 3-year mortality. However, successful CTO-PCI was associated with significantly less subsequent CABG.

TI  - Usefulness of intravascular ultrasound to predict outcomes in short-length lesions treated with drug-eluting stents.
AB  - Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) offers tomographic images of the coronary artery, helping physicians to refine drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in angiographically complex lesions. However, controversy exists regarding whether the routine use of IVUS in short-length lesions leads to improved clinical outcomes after DES implantation. Therefore, we evaluated the usefulness of IVUS in predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization, at 1 year after DES implantation in short-length lesions. The present study was a subanalysis of the REal Safety and Efficacy of a 3-month dual antiplatelet Therapy following Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stent implantation (RESET) study with different clinical outcome parameters. The study population consisted of 662 patients with IVUS guidance and 912 patients with angiography guidance who underwent DES implantation (stent length 24 mm). In the IVUS-guided group, adjuvant postdilation was more frequently performed (43.0% vs 34.6%, p <0.001), and the postintervention minimal lumen diameters were greater (2.88  0.44 mm vs 2.72  0.43 mm, p <0.001). MACE occurred in 15 IVUS-guided (2.3%) and 19 angiographically guided (2.1%) patients (p = 0.872). In a subset of patients with diabetes mellitus (n = 292), the MACE rate was 3.4% (n = 4) and 1.7% (n = 3) in the IVUS- and angiographically guided patients, respectively (p = 0.384). The MACE rate in the IVUS- and angiographically guided patients with acute coronary syndrome (n = 601) was 1.1% (n = 3) and 2.7% (n = 9), respectively (p = 0.194). The clinical benefits of IVUS-guided DES implantation compared with angiographically guided DES implantation in short-length lesions could not be confirmed even in patients with clinically high-risk presentations (acute coronary syndrome and diabetes mellitus). In conclusion, routine IVUS guidance does not provide clinical benefits when performing short-length DES implantation.

AB  - Thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention can result in improved rates of normal epicardial flow and myocardial perfusion, but several unmet needs remain. The purpose of the Delivery of thrombolytIcs before thrombectomy in patientS with ST-segment elevatiOn myocardiaL infarction Undergoing primary percuTaneous coronary interventION (DISSOLUTION) trial was to evaluate the hypothesis that local delivery of thrombolytics can enhance the efficacy of thrombus aspiration in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. A total of 102 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and angiographic evidence of massive thrombosis in the culprit artery were randomly assigned to receive a local, intrathrombus bolus of 200,000 U of urokinase (n = 51) or saline solution (n = 51) by way of an infusion microcatheter, followed by manual aspiration thrombectomy. The end points included the final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade and frame count, myocardial blush grade, 60-minute ST-segment resolution >70%, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, defined as the death, reinfarction, stroke, or clinically driven target vessel revascularization at 6 months. The use of intrathrombus urokinase was associated with a significantly higher incidence of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 (90% vs 66%, p = 0.008) and lower postpercutaneous coronary intervention Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count (19  15 vs 25  17, p = 0.033). The postprocedural myocardial perfusion was significantly increased with the use of urokinase (myocardial blush grade 2 or 3, 68% vs 45%, p = 0.028), with more patients showing ST-segment resolution >70% (82% vs 55%, p = 0.006). At 6 months of follow-up, the patients treated with intrathrombus urokinase showed a better major adverse cardiac event-free survival (6% vs 21%; log-rank p = 0.044). In conclusion, local, intrathrombus delivery of thrombolytics before manual thrombectomy improved the postprocedural coronary flow and myocardial perfusion and the 6-month clinical outcomes.

TI  - EPC mobilization after erythropoietin treatment in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: the REVEAL EPC substudy.
AB  - Erythropoietin (EPO) was hypothesized to mitigate reperfusion injury, in part via mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). The REVEAL trial found no reduction in infarct size with a single dose of EPO (60,000 U) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In a substudy, we aimed to determine the feasibility of cryopreserving and centrally analyzing EPC levels to assess the relationship between EPC numbers, EPO administration, and infarct size. As a prespecified substudy, mononuclear cells were locally cryopreserved before as well as 24 and 48-72 h after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. EPC samples were collected in 163 of 222 enrolled patients. At least one sample was obtained from 125 patients, and all three time points were available in 83 patients. There were no significant differences in the absolute EPC numbers over time or between EPO- and placebo-treated patients; however, there was a trend toward a greater increase in EPC levels from 24 to 48-72 h postintervention in patients receiving 30,000 U of EPO (P = 0.099 for CD133(+) cells, 0.049 for CD34(+) cells, 0.099 for ALDH(br) cells). EPC numbers at baseline were inversely related to infarct size (P = 0.03 for CD133(+) cells, 0.006 for CD34(+) cells). Local whole cell cryopreservation and central EPC analysis in the context of a multicenter randomized trial is feasible but challenging. High-dose (30,000 U) EPO may mobilize EPCs at 48-72 h, and baseline EPC levels may be inversely associated with infarct size.

TI  - Self-rated health predicts outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes and myocardial infarction: a DIGAMI 2 quality of life sub-study.
AB  - The Diabetes mellitus Insulin-Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) 2 Quality of Life (QoL) sub-study included 465 patients with type 2 diabetes and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) followed for 2 years. Self-rated health was reported by the rating scale (RS), graded 0 = death to 100 = perfect health. Prospective associations between RS and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) death and cardiovascular events (CVEs = CV death, non-fatal AMI, stroke) were assessed. Median age was 68 years (range 59-74), 68% male. Patients experiencing CVE (n = 132) or death (n = 71) had lower RS compared with patients free from events: 60 (50-79) versus 70 (55-81) (p < 0.001) and 60 (50-75) versus 70 (51-80) (p = 0.008). The RS score predicted CVE [hazard ratio (HR); 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.87; 0.80-0.95] and all-cause mortality (0.86; 0.76-0.97), and corresponding HRs after adjustment were 0.90; 0.83-0.99 and 0.90; 0.79-1.02, respectively. A low self-rated health is of prognostic importance in patients with type 2 diabetes and AMI and may serve as an easily obtainable indicator of high risk for CVEs supplementing traditional risk factors.

TI  - Increased risk of CVD after VT is determined by common etiologic factors.
AB  - Patients with venous thrombosis (VT) have an increased risk of subsequent CVD (CVD), but the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Using data from the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis follow-up study, 4480 patients with VT, 2926 partner control participants, and 2638 random digit dialing (RDD) control participants were followed-up between 1999 and 2008. Incidence rates and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of CVD (defined as myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke) were calculated for patients vs controls. Measurable confounders (age, sex, body mass index, smoking, chronic disease, malignancy, genetic thrombophilia, and procoagulant markers) were adjusted for when comparing patients with RDD controls. Unmeasured lifestyle-related factors were also considered by comparing patients with their partners. During a median follow-up time of 5 years, 124 CVD events occurred. Incidence of CVD per 1000 person-years was 3.2 (95% CI, 2.5-4.0) in patients, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.5-3.0) in partners, and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.9-2.6) in RDD controls. Crude hazard ratio was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2-3.8) in patients compared with RDD controls and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.3) in patients compared with partners. After adjustment for all confounders, these risks attenuated to 1.8 (95% CI, 0.8-4.2) and 1.3 (95% CI, 0.7-2.5) for patients compared with RDD control participants and partners, respectively. In conclusion, individuals with VT had an increased risk of CVD. This could be explained by common etiologic factors.

TI  - Relation of outbursts of anger and risk of acute myocardial infarction.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore the association between outbursts of anger and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) risk. Outbursts of anger are associated with an abrupt increase in cardiovascular events; however, it remains unknown whether greater levels of anger intensity are associated with greater levels of AMI risk or whether potentially modifiable factors can mitigate the short-term risk of AMI. We conducted a case-crossover analysis of 3,886 participants from the multicenter Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, who were interviewed during the index hospitalization for AMI from 1989 to 1996. We compared the observed number and intensity of anger outbursts in the 2 hours preceding AMI symptom onset with its expected frequency according to each patient's control information, defined as the number of anger outbursts in the previous year. Of the 3,886 participants in the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, 1,484 (38%) reported outbursts of anger in the previous year. The incidence rate of AMI onset was elevated 2.43-fold (95% confidence interval 2.01 to 2.90) within 2 hours of an outburst of anger. The association was consistently stronger with increasing anger intensities (p trend <0.001). In conclusion, the risk of experiencing AMI was more than twofold greater after outbursts of anger compared with at other times, and greater intensities of anger were associated with greater relative risks. Compared with nonusers, regular -blocker users had a lower susceptibility to heart attacks triggered by anger, suggesting that some drugs might lower the risk from each anger episode.
